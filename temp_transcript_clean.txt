If you're skilled a 00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,990 skilled driver I sometimes even say uh 00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000 skilled driver I sometimes even say uh 00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,750 you can get reasonably good output with 00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760 you can get reasonably good output with 00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,990 any tool but codex is just is just 00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000 any tool but codex is just is just 00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,630 really brilliant. It is incredibly slow. 00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640 really brilliant. It is incredibly slow. 00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,470 So sometimes I use like 10 at the same 00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480 So sometimes I use like 10 at the same 00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,750 side at the same time uh like maybe six 00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760 side at the same time uh like maybe six 00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,390 on that screen and to there and to there 00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400 on that screen and to there and to there 00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,710 and I don't like this is already a lot 00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720 and I don't like this is already a lot 00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,150 of complexity in my head there's a lot 00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160 of complexity in my head there's a lot 00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,990 of jumping so I try to minimize anything 00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000 of jumping so I try to minimize anything 00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,950 else that is complexity so in my head 00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960 else that is complexity so in my head 00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,190 main is always shippable I just have 00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200 main is always shippable I just have 00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,470 multiple copies of the same repository 00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480 multiple copies of the same repository 00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,390 that all are on main so I don't have to 00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400 that all are on main so I don't have to 00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,549 deal with how do I name that branch Um 00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559 deal with how do I name that branch Um 00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,230 there could be like conflicts on naming. 00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240 there could be like conflicts on naming. 00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,710 I cannot go back. It's there are certain 00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720 I cannot go back. It's there are certain 00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,470 restrictions when you use work trees 00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480 restrictions when you use work trees 00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,870 that I don't need to care about if it's 00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880 that I don't need to care about if it's 00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,510 copies. I don't like to use a UI because 00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,520 copies. I don't like to use a UI because 00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,350 that's again just added complexity. 00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360 that's again just added complexity. 00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,909 00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919 00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,549 >> Like they're simpler and less friction I 00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559 >> Like they're simpler and less friction I 00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,029 have. All I care about is like syncing 00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039 have. All I care about is like syncing 00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,230 and text. 00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240 and text. 00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,710 00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720 00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,390 >> I don't necessarily need to see so much 00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400 >> I don't necessarily need to see so much 00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,870 code. I I mostly see it like flying by. 00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880 code. I I mostly see it like flying by. 00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,270 Sometimes there's like gnarly stuff that 00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280 Sometimes there's like gnarly stuff that 00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,750 I want to like take a look. But in most 00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,760 I want to like take a look. But in most 00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,630 cases, if you clearly understand the 00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640 cases, if you clearly understand the 00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,070 design and think it through and discuss 00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080 design and think it through and discuss 00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,789 it with your with your agent, it's fine. 00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799 it with your with your agent, it's fine. 00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,590 I'm also very happy that I didn't even 00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600 I'm also very happy that I didn't even 00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,990 build an MCP support. So, Open Claw is 00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000 build an MCP support. So, Open Claw is 00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,070 very successful and there's no MCP 00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080 very successful and there's no MCP 00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,470 support in there. With a small asterisk, 00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480 support in there. With a small asterisk, 00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,430 I built a skill that uses makeporter, 00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440 I built a skill that uses makeporter, 00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,190 which is one of my tools that converts 00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200 which is one of my tools that converts 00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,149 MCPS into CLIs. And then you can just 00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159 MCPS into CLIs. And then you can just 00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,270 use any MCP as a CLI. Um, but I totally 00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280 use any MCP as a CLI. Um, but I totally 00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,710 skip the whole classical MCP crap. So 00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720 skip the whole classical MCP crap. So 00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,470 you because you don't then you can 00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480 you because you don't then you can 00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,110 actually if you need to you can use MCPS 00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120 actually if you need to you can use MCPS 00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,029 on the fly. You don't have to restart 00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039 on the fly. You don't have to restart 00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,029 unlike unlike Codex or cloud code where 00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,039 unlike unlike Codex or cloud code where 00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,390 you actually have to restart the whole 00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400 you actually have to restart the whole 00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,950 thing. I think it's way more egent and 00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960 thing. I think it's way more egent and 00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,950 also scales way better. Now you see 00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960 also scales way better. Now you see 00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,470 entropic they do they built like a tool 00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480 entropic they do they built like a tool 00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,710 called search feature like something 00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720 called search feature like something 00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,830 super custom for MCPS that was like in 00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840 super custom for MCPS that was like in 00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,270 beta because it's like so gnarly. No, 00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280 beta because it's like so gnarly. No, 00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,990 just have CLI bot really is good at 00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000 just have CLI bot really is good at 00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,990 Unix. You can have as many as you want 00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000 Unix. You can have as many as you want 00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,070 and it just works. So like I'm very 00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080 and it just works. So like I'm very 00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,190 happy that I got very little complaints 00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200 happy that I got very little complaints 00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,029 about the MCP stuff. It's kind of back 00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039 about the MCP stuff. It's kind of back 00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,029 to you're just giving it the same tools 00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039 to you're just giving it the same tools 00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,430 that humans liked to use. 00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440 that humans liked to use. 00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,470 00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480 00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,789 >> And not invented stuff for for bots, per 00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799 >> And not invented stuff for for bots, per 00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,110 se. 00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120 se. 00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,149 >> Yeah. Humans, no insane human tries to 00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159 >> Yeah. Humans, no insane human tries to 00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,510 call an MCP manually. 00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520 call an MCP manually. 00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,029 >> Yeah. You just want to use CLIs. 00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039 >> Yeah. You just want to use CLIs. 00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,590 00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600 00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,470 >> That's the future. 00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480 >> That's the future. 00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,070 >> I'm here for it.

Okay. So, if you decide to do intermittent fasting and you do not do keto, okay, let's say you do your regular higher carbohydrate diet and intermittent fasting, uh you may end up with a lot of problems because if you have hypoglycemia and you have blood sugar problems and you do a fast, you're going to feel like crap. Your brain is going to starve of energy because you haven't adapted to fat yet. So, here you are going without food and you're going to feel very funky. It's going to be really hard on your body because you're going to starve your brain cells of glucose. So, anytime you do intermittent fasting, do it with the keto and do it slowly and gradual so you don't starve your brain. Instead, convert the fuel that you're burning to ketones instead of glucose. All right.

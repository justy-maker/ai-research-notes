This was quite the surprise because Claude Sonnet 4.6 had just released as Enthropic made the release within the last hour. This is their most capable Sonnet model yet. And it's a full upgrade across coding, computer use, long context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, as well as designed. And just like the new Claude Opus 4.6 model, it also features a 1 million token context window, which is in beta. This model excels quite well at iterative development, complex codebased navigation, end-to-end project management with memory, polish document creation, and confident computer use for web QA and workflow automation. What's especially impressive about the Claude Sonnet 4.6 is that it's a major leap in computer use capabilities. Early users are actually reporting that it is capable of near humanlike performance on tasks like complex spreadsheet manipulation as well as multi-step web form execution. Now, in regards to pricing, this is priced exactly the same as the Sonnet 4.5 where it is priced at $3 per 1 million input tokens and $6 per 1 million output tokens. In regards to evaluating this model, this is something that delivers near Opus level intelligence at a far more practical price point. It's essentially half the price of Opus 4.6 while being insanely capable. Now, what's remarkable is the fact that this model scored a 79.6 on the Sway Bench verified test. In regards to other uh benchmarks like aentic coding as well as on various sorts of agentic financial analysis, it is achieving state-of-the-art in these regards. It's around twice as fast in comparison to the opus. It's prompt is really great and in a few examples it was even able to beat the opus 4.6. It's quite reliable. It's able to follow instructions better. It hallucinates less and it can handle long context reasoning with the new 1 million context window which is going to be great for strong strategic planning as well as its ability. But you can see that it does insanely well in regards and when you compare it to Gemini 3 Pro as well as the GPT 5.2 that this is just a quite remarkable all-rounded model. If you want the best AI tools, workflows, and drops before everyone else, join my free newsletter with the link in the description below, which is completely free. To get started with this model, you can easily do so now as it is available via the API as well as through their chatbot. So, if you want to easily get started, you can interact with it completely for free. However, through their chatbot, it's going to be heavily rate limited. Another option is using it through LM arena, which is where you can easily access the sonnet 4.6. Open router is another option for you to use it via API and kilo code which is another option where you can use it with the open-source agent which also is going to provide you $25 worth of free credits. So this is a great option for you to use this model completely for free. Now in terms of its front-end capabilities, it is really great with the generations. This is where I had created a premium front-end generation of a SAS landing page and I'm comparing it to the Opus 4.6 six and this is the output I have gotten. This is a new style and a new dynamic that I haven't seen with any other model and it did a great job with the typography, the color palette as well as the foundation of this landing page. So this is quite remarkable and you can see that with all these different components with this front end. So this is a remarkable generation and in my opinion this even tops the Gemini front end. Here is the first iteration of the Mac OS operating system that I had generated, which is pretty remarkable in my opinion. It mimics the full-on dynamic of a Mac OS operating system. You have the Finder app. You have all of these different apps within your toolbar. You have the ability to open up Safari, which is great. None of these components are actually working, but you still see that there's even icons depicting what these apps are. You have a notes app. You have a mail app, photos, which is pretty cool. And you even have a terminal that is functioning, a calculator, as well as a system settings. And you have the ability to tweak these different components. Now, I'm going to work on implementing more features to make this even better within the cloud app. This is the front end of the Mac OS operating system that I had generated. Now, it seems to be a little flawed, but this is the output that I have gotten, which is crazy cuz we have functional components from even the file manager. But you have the ability to add in new folders, change the wallpaper, you can open up the folder, you can open up your desktop, you have the ability to even open up these different apps. Incredible, guys. Now, this is where I can even play the music. It rotates the icon, which is cool. There is a functional time bar for the music that is being played. You have the ability to also have it open up these top bar tools like the battery, the Wi-Fi, changing the brightness, which is incredible. You have the ability to change the volume as well. You even have a spotlight search like you would within Mac OS, mimicking the same functionality of a MacOSS operating system. And in this case, it did do probably one of the best jobs in generating this. Now, our first test is deploying multiple agents with Kilo code to create a Minecraft clone. And this is with the free API. And this is where I'm trying to see if it's going to be able to create a working inventory. And one thing I've noticed is that this model is pretty fast in comparison to Opus. It's able to take in your implementation and start generating the code that is necessary. So, it looks like Kilo has finished developing our Minecraft clone and we can actually visualize it within our browser. This is Boxelcraft and we can create a new world. We can load up one and you can even configure the settings, but we're going to create a new one, which is great because no other Minecraft clone has set this up where you start off by creating your own clone. Now, this is where you can tweak the settings, but we're not going to be doing that. Let me click out of this. And this is the first generation that I have seen that actually has terrain generation. You have a heart bar as well as a food bar. You have the ability to move. Now, it's extremely laggy right now cuz I had generated this to be functional on a browser, but I have the ability to even place down different blocks. I can break down different blocks, which you can see that I'm breaking the dirt right now, and it is adding the dirt, but it's not actually showcasing that it's breaking it. Now, you also have the ability to place different blocks, but right now, it is extremely buggy and laggy right now. So, I have reprompted it to actually lower the specs so that it is able to actually be hosted on my browser. And you can see that the quality definitely dipped, but I have the ability to actually uh go ahead and actually run around this terrain. And something cool that I noticed is that if I am to look down into the caves, you can see that it actually did a generation of all of the underground terrain as well, which is kind of cool. I have the ability to break the blocks now, which is great. I can place on different blocks, but the formatting of the block structure is still kind of a little buggy, which is the only downside, but still it is a cool little generation that I was able to output. Now, in my next prompt, I had requested to create a 3D simulation of a Formula 1 car performing continuous drifting donuts. And you can see that there's drift marks on the bottom, which is great. There's different aerial as well as sidecam views. And it is actually pretty cool how the smoke is only coming out from the back tires which is remarkable. Showcases the drift, the RPM as well as the speed. And you also have the different cameras. I don't know if the drifting dynamics is perfect in this case, but it did do a better job in my opinion than the Opus cuz it looks a lot more cleaner and a lot more intuitive. The perspective of the 3D simulation is better cuz it's able to understand and coordinate the system. the perspective projection as well as the animation logic. So in this case, it did do a great job with this output. Next up are the SVG generations. And this is where I'm testing how proficient it is in outputting SVG code. This is the butterfly. It has outputed a different gradient and it did do the job perfect, but it's not something that is extraordinary or anything, but it is a simple butterfly. that generated other developers like Ken as well as including myself with the SVG generation. I didn't get the best output that mimicked the output quality of Opus 4.6, but it still did do a decent job with the output. This is where I created a robot in SVG, a Pelican riding a bike, as well as a PS5 controller. It did do a decent job, but it's still not mimicking the same sort of quality as the Opus 4.6. Here, I had requested it to create a 3D room design that showcases how the overall orbit control works with this room design, and it did do a pretty decent job cuz you have the ability to work with different furniturees. You can toggle them on or off. You can also uh visualize how it looks during the night, which it didn't do a decent job with this particular generation, but still it did a decent job in terms of generating all the components. And in 3JS, it usually was able to do a good job with the output with certain uh furniture designs as well as the overall structure of this orbit room. This is a cool fun little thing I had developed with VS Code and Kilo Code. And this is a marble labyrinth game that is going to allow you to actually replicate a board tilt by moving your mouse around. And it did a great job in illustrating the fullon physics of this game. It is something that works as well and it is quite hard to actually work or play because if I am to go into a hole you can see that I need to then try again to complete all the checkpoints. So this is a pretty cool generation that it was able to actually output. Next up is a browser comp prompt that I am essentially sending into Kilo and this is where it's going to autonomously set up all these components with the 4.6. Essentially, I wanted to work on setting up the project autonomously where it's going to create the browser automation file, create a task list, data generate uh various sorts of components within a CSV file, which you can see that it is already doing right away. It is also going to create an HTML dashboard, a Python browser automation script, and we're just stress testing this model and how many requests it's able to take on and complete. And right now it is working on the browser automation where it is able to use this automate Python script that can use Selenium or Playright to open up a browser, perform a Google search for the latest AI news, which we're going to be running in a second, and then scrape the top five headlines. So this is the browser automation dashboard that AI generated that displays the weather, the numbers within that CSV file as well as the number grid that we had requested. Now it has even connected the Python script to this front end that it had developed. And we're going to run it once it finishes generating the automate pi file. So we can actually fetch the AI headlines using playright. And you can see right away it does a fast job in scraping the top five headlines. So that is one remarkable thing about this model in terms of its browser automation. It's able to use these different components really quick and generate all of these components in a small efficient time period.

But in conclusion, guys, this model is the best bang for your buck. you're getting near Opus intelligence at a much practical speed and cost ratio in terms of its overall usage. I think this is a great model for a gentic use cases especially for computer browser automation as well as reasoning across huge context. The 1 million context is definitely going to get you the best output. So that is really nice to see and it is able to reliably follow complex instructions a lot better than previous Sonic models as well as better than uh Gemini cuz Gemini is a lot lazier with its output and in this case the enthropic models are better with the following through with instructions. So that is definitely the pros of this model. But that's essentially it guys for today's video. I'll leave all these links in the description below.

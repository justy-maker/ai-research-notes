In the 1980s, a small group of funds started using computers to analyze markets. At the time, it seems silly, but quantitative trading is now [music] obvious. We're at a similar inflection point now, and the next Renaissance, Bridgewater, and De Shaw are going to be built on AI. [music] The biggest hedge funds in the world have been slow to adapt. I worked as a quant researcher at one of these funds, and when I asked Compliance to let us use ChateBT, I didn't even get a response. It made it clear to me that the hedge funds of the future won't just bolt AI onto their existing strategies. They'll use it to come up with entirely new ones. That's where the alpha is. We've already got swarms of cloud agents writing our [music] code bases. Imagine swarms of agents doing what hedge fund traders do now. Combing through 10Ks, earnings calls, and SEC filings, synthesizing analyst ideas, and making trades. An AI native hedge fund will be the first to do this well. If you're excited about building the frontier of finance, apply to YC.

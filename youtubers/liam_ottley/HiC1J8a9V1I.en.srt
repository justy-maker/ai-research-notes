One of the biggest questions right now
 

3
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,030
One of the biggest questions right now
in the AI agency market is how to scale

4
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,040
in the AI agency market is how to scale
 

5
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,630
in the AI agency market is how to scale
effectively without fully niching down

6
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:04,640
effectively without fully niching down
 

7
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,470
effectively without fully niching down
to a productized service model. And one

00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
to a productized service model. And one
 

9
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,990
to a productized service model. And one
of the top contenders for the answer to

pros and cons of it and how it works in
 

21
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,750
pros and cons of it and how it works in
reality, I've brought on Brandon who's

22
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
reality, I've brought on Brandon who's
 

23
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,950
reality, I've brought on Brandon who's
going to be breaking down how he's been

24
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
going to be breaking down how he's been
 

25
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,029
going to be breaking down how he's been
doing at his agency to scale his agency

26
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
doing at his agency to scale his agency
 

27
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,950
doing at his agency to scale his agency
with a quality of clients rather than a

28
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
with a quality of clients rather than a
 

29
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,470
with a quality of clients rather than a
quantity. This is very closely aligned

30
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
quantity. This is very closely aligned
 

31
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,070
quantity. This is very closely aligned
with how my team at Morningside have

32
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
with how my team at Morningside have
 

33
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,109
with how my team at Morningside have
been delivering for our clients

34
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
been delivering for our clients
 

35
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,550

Brandon, thanks for coming on, man. I'm

62
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
Brandon, thanks for coming on, man. I'm
 

63
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,950
Brandon, thanks for coming on, man. I'm
excited to get into this. I think this

64
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
excited to get into this. I think this
 

65
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,549
excited to get into this. I think this
is one of the most important topics to

66
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
is one of the most important topics to
 

67
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,069
is one of the most important topics to
be talking about around scaling an

68
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
be talking about around scaling an
 

69
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,389
be talking about around scaling an
agency in 2026. It's definitely made the

70
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
agency in 2026. It's definitely made the
 

71
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,389
agency in 2026. It's definitely made the
rounds in the news recently. um and all

72
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
rounds in the news recently. um and all
 

73
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,750
rounds in the news recently. um and all
the startup scenes about using this

74
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
the startup scenes about using this
 

75
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,590
the startup scenes about using this
model. So, I thought I'd bring you on as

76
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
model. So, I thought I'd bring you on as
 

77
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,869
model. So, I thought I'd bring you on as
someone who's actively been using this

78
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
someone who's actively been using this
 

79
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,270
someone who's actively been using this
to uh scale your agency and give us a

80
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
to uh scale your agency and give us a
 

81
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,710
to uh scale your agency and give us a
source on how this model actually looks

82
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
source on how this model actually looks
 

83
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,469
source on how this model actually looks
within an AI agency format. I think

84
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
within an AI agency format. I think
 

85
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,990
within an AI agency format. I think
firstly, let's just get clear on what

86
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
firstly, let's just get clear on what
 

87
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,990
firstly, let's just get clear on what
the what a what a ford deployed engineer

88
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
the what a what a ford deployed engineer
 

89
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,030
the what a what a ford deployed engineer
is. I think that's the first thing

90
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
is. I think that's the first thing
 

91
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,310
is. I think that's the first thing
people are going to want to know. So,

92
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
people are going to want to know. So,
 

93
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,230
people are going to want to know. So,
what is a forward deployed engineer?

94
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
what is a forward deployed engineer?
 

95
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,990
what is a forward deployed engineer?
What is the forward deployed engineer

96
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
What is the forward deployed engineer
 

97
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,310
What is the forward deployed engineer
model? Uh and how does that look when

98
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
model? Uh and how does that look when
 

99
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,429
model? Uh and how does that look when
you apply to an agency?

100
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
you apply to an agency?
 

101
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,749
you apply to an agency?
>> The Ford uh deployment engineering model

102
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
>> The Ford uh deployment engineering model
 

103
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,469
>> The Ford uh deployment engineering model
uh was first pioneered by Palunteer. uh

104
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
uh was first pioneered by Palunteer. uh
 

105
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,510
uh was first pioneered by Palunteer. uh
they started working specifically with

106
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
they started working specifically with
 

107
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,990
they started working specifically with
this sort of methodology. Um there's

108
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
this sort of methodology. Um there's
 

109
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,190
this sort of methodology. Um there's
also four deployed strategists. So uh

110
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
also four deployed strategists. So uh
 

111
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,990
also four deployed strategists. So uh
typically it's a echo and delta team

112
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
typically it's a echo and delta team
 

113
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,550
typically it's a echo and delta team
where uh the echo team actually works

114
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
where uh the echo team actually works
 

115
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,030
where uh the echo team actually works
strictly with the business side um and

116
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
strictly with the business side um and
 

117
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,030
strictly with the business side um and
tries to figure out on the front lines

118
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
tries to figure out on the front lines
 

119
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,950
tries to figure out on the front lines
what that team needs and bridges the gap

120
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
what that team needs and bridges the gap
 

121
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,550
what that team needs and bridges the gap
between tech and the data. And so the

122
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
between tech and the data. And so the
 

123
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,550
between tech and the data. And so the
delta team is the tech team essentially,

124
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
delta team is the tech team essentially,
 

125
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,030
delta team is the tech team essentially,
but they would um also work with the

126
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
but they would um also work with the
 

127
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,190
but they would um also work with the
echo team to figure out how much

128
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
echo team to figure out how much
 

129
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,789
echo team to figure out how much
inefficiencies that they can sort of

130
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
inefficiencies that they can sort of
 

131
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,109
inefficiencies that they can sort of
remove or improve processes for. So

132
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
remove or improve processes for. So
 

133
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,870
remove or improve processes for. So
linking this to say like the AI

00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
linking this to say like the AI

you've said we're going into companies
 

139
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,190
you've said we're going into companies

AI agency doing a like me sending one of

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
AI agency doing a like me sending one of
 

165
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,550
AI agency doing a like me sending one of
my consultants? We sent two of my

166
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
my consultants? We sent two of my
 

167

00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
went out to do an inerson audit um in in
 

171
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,949
went out to do an inerson audit um in in
the United States with our MBA uh client

172
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
the United States with our MBA uh client
 

173
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,509
the United States with our MBA uh client
and they I guess they were a team of

174
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
and they I guess they were a team of
 

175
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,869
and they I guess they were a team of
four deployed engineers out there.

176
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
four deployed engineers out there.
 

177
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,390
four deployed engineers out there.
>> I think the there's a couple things that

178
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
>> I think the there's a couple things that
 

179
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,309
>> I think the there's a couple things that
make it different. Uh the first thing is

180
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
make it different. Uh the first thing is
 

181
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,710
make it different. Uh the first thing is
how rigorous the the audit process is.

182
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
how rigorous the the audit process is.
 

183
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,910
how rigorous the the audit process is.
So um it goes into like being included

184
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
So um it goes into like being included
 

185
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,309
So um it goes into like being included
in their group chats, being a part of

186
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
in their group chats, being a part of
 

187
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,390
in their group chats, being a part of
their CRM, like a member in their CRM.

188
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
their CRM, like a member in their CRM.
 

189
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,670
their CRM, like a member in their CRM.
So you're monitoring a lot of the

190
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
So you're monitoring a lot of the
 

191
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,070
So you're monitoring a lot of the
processes that happen digitally. You're

192
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
processes that happen digitally. You're
 

193
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,150
processes that happen digitally. You're
also thinking about the product. So

194
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,160
also thinking about the product. So
 

195
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,030
also thinking about the product. So
you're not only looking at the processes

196
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
you're not only looking at the processes
 

197
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,630
you're not only looking at the processes
that happen internally or externally,

198
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
that happen internally or externally,
 

199
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,550
that happen internally or externally,
you're looking at what possible things

200
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
you're looking at what possible things
 

201
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,350
you're looking at what possible things
have overlap um in keeping the product

202
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
have overlap um in keeping the product
 

203
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,750
have overlap um in keeping the product
in mind. So if there's anything that's

204
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
in mind. So if there's anything that's
 

205
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,750
in mind. So if there's anything that's
repeatable across other clients for

206
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
repeatable across other clients for
 

207
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,750
repeatable across other clients for
example we target service based

208
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
example we target service based
 

209
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,190
example we target service based
businesses but even more niche right a

210
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
businesses but even more niche right a
 

211
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,869
businesses but even more niche right a
vertical within service base would be

212
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
vertical within service base would be
 

213
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,750
vertical within service base would be
dispatching for scheduling for sales

214
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
dispatching for scheduling for sales
 

215
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,350
dispatching for scheduling for sales
training right so how can we use that

216
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
training right so how can we use that
 

217
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,670
training right so how can we use that
data that we've that we've gathered to

218
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
data that we've that we've gathered to
 

219
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,589
data that we've that we've gathered to
build that product build that scalable

220
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
build that product build that scalable
 

221
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,630
build that product build that scalable
product so I guess this is you could say

265
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,149
the portal or the dashboard or the tool
that we've just talked about here would

266
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
that we've just talked about here would
 

267
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,069
that we've just talked about here would
look like. So you're finding people who

268
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
look like. So you're finding people who
 

269
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,509
look like. So you're finding people who
make that skill set and then you're

270
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
make that skill set and then you're
 

271
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,949
make that skill set and then you're
deploying them into you're sending them

272
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
deploying them into you're sending them
 

273
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,270
deploying them into you're sending them
out or digitally sending them out to one

274
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
out or digitally sending them out to one
 

275
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,790
out or digitally sending them out to one
of your clients and are you like

276
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
of your clients and are you like
 

277
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,629
of your clients and are you like
aligning that one to one? So it's one

278
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
aligning that one to one? So it's one
 

279
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,749
aligning that one to one? So it's one
one one employee, one of these engineer

280
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
one one employee, one of these engineer

consultant hybrids that's deployed into
 

283
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,629
consultant hybrids that's deployed into
your company and like what's the split?

284
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
your company and like what's the split?
 

285
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,990
your company and like what's the split?
Are you having them working at multiple

286
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
Are you having them working at multiple
 

287
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,990
Are you having them working at multiple
or is it more of a one for one uh setup?

288
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
or is it more of a one for one uh setup?
 

289
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,830
or is it more of a one for one uh setup?
Currently we have it as a one for one.

290
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
Currently we have it as a one for one.
 

291
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,150
Currently we have it as a one for one.
So uh me and my co-founder and then we

292
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
So uh me and my co-founder and then we
 

293
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,110
So uh me and my co-founder and then we
have a small dev team. um we try to take

294
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
have a small dev team. um we try to take
 

295
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,270
have a small dev team. um we try to take
one client at a time although we could

296
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
one client at a time although we could
 

297
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,189
one client at a time although we could
process multiple clients if we needed to

298
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
process multiple clients if we needed to
 

299
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,870
process multiple clients if we needed to
but yeah with the advent of AI it makes

300
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
but yeah with the advent of AI it makes
 

301
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,110
but yeah with the advent of AI it makes
it so that we can actually build to the

302
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
it so that we can actually build to the
 

303
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,310
it so that we can actually build to the
need right so it's counterintuitive to

304
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
need right so it's counterintuitive to
 

305
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,150
need right so it's counterintuitive to
trying to find a product that meets

306
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
trying to find a product that meets
 

307
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,030
trying to find a product that meets
everyone's need or scaling at least it's

308
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
everyone's need or scaling at least it's
 

309
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,629
everyone's need or scaling at least it's
actually the most unscalable thing it's

310
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
actually the most unscalable thing it's
 

311
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,550
actually the most unscalable thing it's
very custom so we actually are building

312
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
very custom so we actually are building
 

313
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,550
very custom so we actually are building
to the need and then they can see those

314
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
to the need and then they can see those
 

315
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,390
to the need and then they can see those

317
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,790
results right away and provides a lot of
value up front and there's I feel like

318
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
value up front and there's I feel like
 

319
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,390
value up front and there's I feel like
there's nothing wrong that. But the only

320
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
there's nothing wrong that. But the only
 

321
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,550
there's nothing wrong that. But the only
issue is that it doesn't it's not it's

322
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
issue is that it doesn't it's not it's
 

323
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,510
issue is that it doesn't it's not it's
not sexy. That's for sure.

over the place. It's get they're going
 

335
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,830
over the place. It's get they're going
from 20 or 30k down to like five and

from 20 or 30k down to like five and
 

337
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,270

345
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,670
what we're going to talk about here?

Like how is that the medicine to to what

different to what they're currently
 

351
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,830
different to what they're currently
doing? Um I know you've got some stuff

352
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
doing? Um I know you've got some stuff
 

353
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,390

to talk about on the Legion side, but if

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
to talk about on the Legion side, but if
 

355
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,469
to talk about on the Legion side, but if
I'm struggling to scale, um why is this

356
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
I'm struggling to scale, um why is this
 

357
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,990
I'm struggling to scale, um why is this
the the medicine I might be looking for?

358
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
the the medicine I might be looking for?
 

359
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,150
the the medicine I might be looking for?
If you're struggling to scale, then um

360
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
If you're struggling to scale, then um
 

361
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,830
If you're struggling to scale, then um
it would be looking for other things

362
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
it would be looking for other things
 

363
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,230
it would be looking for other things
that that client might need. So being

364
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
that that client might need. So being
 

365
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,990
that that client might need. So being
able to get that recurring revenue, I

366
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
able to get that recurring revenue, I
 

367
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,749
able to get that recurring revenue, I
think that's the first step. So seeing

368
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
think that's the first step. So seeing
 

369
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,150
think that's the first step. So seeing
why they're not coming back, why is it

370
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
why they're not coming back, why is it
 

371
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,230
why they're not coming back, why is it
that is it the customer journey? Is it

372
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
that is it the customer journey? Is it
 

373
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,990
that is it the customer journey? Is it
the price? Um, and then once you like

374
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
the price? Um, and then once you like
 

375
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,430
the price? Um, and then once you like
lock down that, it's it is more of a

376
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
lock down that, it's it is more of a
 

377
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,110
lock down that, it's it is more of a
in-depth relationship. So, it's built on

378
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
in-depth relationship. So, it's built on
 

379
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,070
in-depth relationship. So, it's built on
a lot of trust.

380
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
a lot of trust.
 

381
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,430
a lot of trust.

the trust you build up is the solution

the trust you build up is the solution
to the scaling problem is to be able to

00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
to the scaling problem is to be able to
 

413
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,950
to the scaling problem is to be able to

but it's actually just for doing more
 

421
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,350
but it's actually just for doing more

work. I suppose you could get into the
 

423
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,430
work. I suppose you could get into the
retainer eventually. Um, but you're

424
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
retainer eventually. Um, but you're
 

425
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,189
retainer eventually. Um, but you're
saying that's that's what this this

426
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
saying that's that's what this this
 

427
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,830
saying that's that's what this this
model offers.

431
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,830
>> Yeah, it's it's more relationship based
like you said. It's um us going out into

432
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
like you said. It's um us going out into
 

433
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,110
like you said. It's um us going out into
the field. So, we're you can't really

434
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
the field. So, we're you can't really
 

435
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,110
the field. So, we're you can't really
build, let's say, an inventory system if

436
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
build, let's say, an inventory system if
 

437
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,270
build, let's say, an inventory system if
you're not inside their warehouse. So, a

438
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
you're not inside their warehouse. So, a
 

439
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,790
you're not inside their warehouse. So, a
lot of the clients we have, they're

440
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
lot of the clients we have, they're
 

441
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,350
lot of the clients we have, they're
local to LA. They're in Orange County.

442
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
local to LA. They're in Orange County.
 

443
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,830
local to LA. They're in Orange County.
They're um even the state of California.

444
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
They're um even the state of California.
 

445
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,670
They're um even the state of California.
So, we can't really do a lot of these

446
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
So, we can't really do a lot of these
 

447
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,589
So, we can't really do a lot of these
things through Zoom. Unfortunately, it

448
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
things through Zoom. Unfortunately, it
 

449
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,029
things through Zoom. Unfortunately, it
actually has to be seen with our own

450
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
actually has to be seen with our own
 

451
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,350
actually has to be seen with our own
eyes. And I think with the industry that

452
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
eyes. And I think with the industry that
 

453
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,510
eyes. And I think with the industry that
we've tackled, which is service based,

454
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
we've tackled, which is service based,
 

455
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,830
we've tackled, which is service based,
they do like actually seeing us in

456
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
they do like actually seeing us in
 

457
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,990
they do like actually seeing us in
person cuz they're very visual learners

458
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
person cuz they're very visual learners
 

459
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,230
person cuz they're very visual learners
and they

460
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
and they
 

461
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,350
and they
do see what they want to see. I said

462
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
do see what they want to see. I said
 

463
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,029
do see what they want to see. I said
that in my um my predictions vid for

this for 2026. I think people who get
out there in person, there's a a huge

468
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
out there in person, there's a a huge
 

469
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,270
out there in person, there's a a huge
opportunity for these AI agencies and

470
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
opportunity for these AI agencies and
 

471
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,110
opportunity for these AI agencies and
and AI service providers to get get the

472
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
and AI service providers to get get the
 

473
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,469
and AI service providers to get get the
 out there in person and meet these

474
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
out there in person and meet these
 

475
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,990
out there in person and meet these
people. Well, like you would not believe

476
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
people. Well, like you would not believe
 

477
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,510
people. Well, like you would not believe
the the relationship that we've been

478
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
the the relationship that we've been
 

479
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,790
the the relationship that we've been
able to build up with our clients, but

480
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
able to build up with our clients, but
 

481
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,710
able to build up with our clients, but
actually getting in person like building

482
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
actually getting in person like building
 

483
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,710
actually getting in person like building
a real relationship where it's like that

484
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
a real relationship where it's like that
 

485
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,950
a real relationship where it's like that
mutual respect. It just unlocks a

486
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
mutual respect. It just unlocks a
 

487
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,230
mutual respect. It just unlocks a
different level to the game and it's

488
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
different level to the game and it's
 

489
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,749
different level to the game and it's
like we will be able to work with these

490
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
like we will be able to work with these
 

491
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,110
like we will be able to work with these
people and make them money. They will

492
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
people and make them money. They will
 

493
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,950
people and make them money. They will
make us money for as long as we're able

494
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
make us money for as long as we're able
 

495
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,710
make us money for as long as we're able
to deliver on our promises. And that's

496
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
to deliver on our promises. And that's
 

497
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,150
to deliver on our promises. And that's
something that I think the digital side

498
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
something that I think the digital side
 

499
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,670
something that I think the digital side
of things doesn't really capture fully.

500
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
of things doesn't really capture fully.
 

501
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,589
of things doesn't really capture fully.
So um I think that's a good sort of

502
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
So um I think that's a good sort of
 

503
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,350
So um I think that's a good sort of
primer on this model and how it's

504
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
primer on this model and how it's
 

505
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,629
primer on this model and how it's
different. It's you could I suppose for

506
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
different. It's you could I suppose for
 

507
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,550
different. It's you could I suppose for
those who are new to this it's like the

508
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
those who are new to this it's like the
 

509
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,469
those who are new to this it's like the
AI transformation partner model is

510
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
AI transformation partner model is
 

511
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,150
AI transformation partner model is
primarily uh is scaled through using

512
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
primarily uh is scaled through using
 

513
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,589
primarily uh is scaled through using
these for deployed engineers to go out

514
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
these for deployed engineers to go out
 

515
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,189
these for deployed engineers to go out
there and get in person. It doesn't

516
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
there and get in person. It doesn't
 

517
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,469
there and get in person. It doesn't
necessarily have to be in person but it

518
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
necessarily have to be in person but it
 

519
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,110
necessarily have to be in person but it
can be. Um, but by sending a consultant

520
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
can be. Um, but by sending a consultant
 

521
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,790
can be. Um, but by sending a consultant
who's likely a little bit more dangerous

522
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
who's likely a little bit more dangerous
 

523
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,390
who's likely a little bit more dangerous
on the technical side to really

524
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
on the technical side to really
 

525
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,589
on the technical side to really
understand their business and having

526
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
understand their business and having
 

527
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,950
understand their business and having
someone who's like the point of contact,

528
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
someone who's like the point of contact,
 

529
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,110
someone who's like the point of contact,
who's super deep to be able to identify

530
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
who's super deep to be able to identify
 

531
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,949
who's super deep to be able to identify
those, uh, those opportunities and then

532
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
those, uh, those opportunities and then
 

533
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,670
those, uh, those opportunities and then
report that back to, uh, the dev team to

534
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
report that back to, uh, the dev team to
 

535
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,029
report that back to, uh, the dev team to
be able to to build those and he's sort

536
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
be able to to build those and he's sort
 

537
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,029
be able to to build those and he's sort
of middlemaning those from there. So,

538
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
of middlemaning those from there. So,
 

539
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,029
of middlemaning those from there. So,

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,310
business. I'll see you in there. My job
as CEO is mainly to make sure that we

580
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
as CEO is mainly to make sure that we
 

581
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,910
as CEO is mainly to make sure that we
have enough opportunities on the plate

582
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
have enough opportunities on the plate
 

583
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,949
have enough opportunities on the plate
for the people that work for me. So, um

584
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
for the people that work for me. So, um
 

585
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,269
for the people that work for me. So, um
it's a lot of networking, doing speaking

586
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
it's a lot of networking, doing speaking
 

587
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,350
it's a lot of networking, doing speaking
engage engagements like this, but also

588
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
engage engagements like this, but also
 

589
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,630
engage engagements like this, but also
connecting with people at a level that

590
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
connecting with people at a level that
 

591
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,350
connecting with people at a level that
they can understand. So, um that's the

592
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
they can understand. So, um that's the
 

593
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,470
they can understand. So, um that's the
marketing and networking side. Like I

594
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
marketing and networking side. Like I
 

595
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,389
marketing and networking side. Like I
said, we've spent no money on sales or

596
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
said, we've spent no money on sales or
 

597
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,470
said, we've spent no money on sales or
marketing, but I think the biggest thing

598
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
marketing, but I think the biggest thing
 

599
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,030
marketing, but I think the biggest thing
is referrals and like finding leads uh

600
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
is referrals and like finding leads uh
 

601
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,550
is referrals and like finding leads uh
internally. And I want to just touch on

602
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
internally. And I want to just touch on
 

603
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,070
internally. And I want to just touch on
a little bit too like some of these

604
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
a little bit too like some of these
 

605
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,750
a little bit too like some of these
automations don't need to be agentic all

606
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
automations don't need to be agentic all
 

607
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,910
automations don't need to be agentic all
the time. So some of our first clients

608
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
the time. So some of our first clients
 

609
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,070
the time. So some of our first clients
that we had, they were just purely AI

610
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
that we had, they were just purely AI
 

611
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,150
that we had, they were just purely AI
automation. So it's like digitizing a

612
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
automation. So it's like digitizing a
 

613
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,190
automation. So it's like digitizing a
form for instance. So it doesn't always

614
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
form for instance. So it doesn't always
 

615
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,350
form for instance. So it doesn't always
have to be an AI agent. It can just

616
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
have to be an AI agent. It can just
 

617
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,110
have to be an AI agent. It can just
start off as something smaller that they

618
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
start off as something smaller that they
 

619
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,509
start off as something smaller that they
think they need or that provide a lot of

620
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
think they need or that provide a lot of
 

621
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,550
think they need or that provide a lot of
value and then after that they're hooked

622
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
value and then after that they're hooked
 

623
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,829
value and then after that they're hooked
and then you can basically pitch them

624
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
and then you can basically pitch them
 

625
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,430
and then you can basically pitch them
more things and then it can become a

626
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
more things and then it can become a
 

627
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,389
more things and then it can become a
recurring model after that.

628
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
recurring model after that.
 

629
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,509
recurring model after that.
>> Yeah, I think a lot of the time the

630
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
>> Yeah, I think a lot of the time the
 

631
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,070
>> Yeah, I think a lot of the time the
agent is actually not necessary. Um, and

632
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,080
agent is actually not necessary. Um, and
 

633
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,910
agent is actually not necessary. Um, and
I've been planning a big AI agents

634
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
I've been planning a big AI agents
 

635
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,670
I've been planning a big AI agents
tutorial for beginners. And I was like,

636
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
tutorial for beginners. And I was like,
 

637
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,269
tutorial for beginners. And I was like,
hm, could I could I have just done this

638
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
hm, could I could I have just done this
 

639
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,190
hm, could I could I have just done this
with a like linear kind of automation

640
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
with a like linear kind of automation
 

641
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,710
with a like linear kind of automation
with a classification step or something,

642
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
with a classification step or something,
 

643
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,870
with a classification step or something,
and if the answer is yes, then it's it's

644
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
and if the answer is yes, then it's it's
 

645
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,470
and if the answer is yes, then it's it's
like makes more sense to just do it with

646
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
like makes more sense to just do it with
 

647
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,389
like makes more sense to just do it with
a a more linear like automation with

648
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
a a more linear like automation with
 

649
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,269
a a more linear like automation with
some AI in it. It's like the the agent

650
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
some AI in it. It's like the the agent
 

651
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,829
some AI in it. It's like the the agent
really shines when there's varied input

652
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
really shines when there's varied input
 

653
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,509
really shines when there's varied input
and a bunch of different options that it

654
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
and a bunch of different options that it
 

655
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,110
and a bunch of different options that it
could do with that and and routes it

656
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
could do with that and and routes it
 

657
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,790
could do with that and and routes it
could it could take that afterwards. So,

658
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
could it could take that afterwards. So,
 

659
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,389
could it could take that afterwards. So,
that's that's a great point. While we're

660
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
that's that's a great point. While we're
 

661
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,829
that's that's a great point. While we're
there, you didn't quite reveal how

662
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
there, you didn't quite reveal how
 

663
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,110
there, you didn't quite reveal how
you're getting your leads. You're you

664
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
you're getting your leads. You're you
 

665
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,150
you're getting your leads. You're you
going to networking events?

666
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
going to networking events?
 

667
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,509
going to networking events?
>> Yeah, a little bit of everything. So, I

668
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
>> Yeah, a little bit of everything. So, I
 

669
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,910
>> Yeah, a little bit of everything. So, I
was just in Vegas for CES a couple weeks

670
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
was just in Vegas for CES a couple weeks
 

671
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,030
was just in Vegas for CES a couple weeks
ago. Um, investor dinners I get always

672
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
ago. Um, investor dinners I get always
 

673
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,350
ago. Um, investor dinners I get always
invited to like once a week. Uh, found a

674
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
invited to like once a week. Uh, found a
 

675
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,269
invited to like once a week. Uh, found a
trash day, bro. How how are you doing

676
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
trash day, bro. How how are you doing
 

677
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,509
trash day, bro. How how are you doing
that?

678
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
that?
 

679
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,190
that?
>> I'm a part of a lot of communities. So,

680
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
>> I'm a part of a lot of communities. So,
 

681
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,389
>> I'm a part of a lot of communities. So,
there's one community, AI LA, if I can

682
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
there's one community, AI LA, if I can
 

683
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,590
there's one community, AI LA, if I can
shout them out. There's creator

684
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
shout them out. There's creator
 

685
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,310
shout them out. There's creator
communities here in LA. So, LA, not the

686
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
communities here in LA. So, LA, not the
 

687
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,550
communities here in LA. So, LA, not the
hugest hub for AI. I mean SF is you're

688
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
hugest hub for AI. I mean SF is you're
 

689
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,630
hugest hub for AI. I mean SF is you're
going to be going to be your AI hub but

690
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
going to be going to be your AI hub but
 

691
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,350
going to be going to be your AI hub but
ALA has its own culture and personality

692
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
ALA has its own culture and personality
 

693
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,389
ALA has its own culture and personality
that focuses more on like creatives um

694
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
that focuses more on like creatives um
 

695
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,030
that focuses more on like creatives um
but also um they like AI too. So there's

696
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
but also um they like AI too. So there's
 

697
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,670
but also um they like AI too. So there's
a couple of techies in here um on beach

698
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
a couple of techies in here um on beach
 

699
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,230
a couple of techies in here um on beach
they call it.

700
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
they call it.
 

701

city uh see what groups there are
communities there are around AI and

706
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
communities there are around AI and
 

707
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,710

>> I think that's it like there is even
 

711
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,069

something extreme as just like

712
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
something extreme as just like
 

713
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,630
something extreme as just like

called Salt Box, but there's businesses

736
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
called Salt Box, but there's businesses
 

737
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,829
called Salt Box, but there's businesses
all around here, and I've been

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,870
can build out their mind map of their
business hierarchy or you can start

776
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
business hierarchy or you can start
 

777
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,190
business hierarchy or you can start
asking them um interviewing some of

778
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
asking them um interviewing some of
 

779
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,230
asking them um interviewing some of
their employees and really get a really

780
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
their employees and really get a really
 

781
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,230
their employees and really get a really
good idea and this is usually like a

782
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
good idea and this is usually like a
 

783
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,750
good idea and this is usually like a
this could be from a day depending on

784
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
this could be from a day depending on
 

785
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,990
this could be from a day depending on
how large the business is to a week or

786
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
how large the business is to a week or
 

787
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,870
how large the business is to a week or
to two weeks. Um but it's a really good

788
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
to two weeks. Um but it's a really good
 

789
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,110
to two weeks. Um but it's a really good
spot to actually build that relationship

790
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
spot to actually build that relationship
 

791
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,509
spot to actually build that relationship
and then also get an idea of what things

792
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
and then also get an idea of what things
 

793
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,230
and then also get an idea of what things
you can tackle uh and you can propose

794
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
you can tackle uh and you can propose
 

795
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,310
you can tackle uh and you can propose
for the next week. I read a a really

796
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
for the next week. I read a a really
 

797
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,949
for the next week. I read a a really
really interesting article from A16Z

798
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
really interesting article from A16Z
 

799
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,190
really interesting article from A16Z
recently uh called the pelterization of

800
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
recently uh called the pelterization of
 

801
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,389
recently uh called the pelterization of
everything. It was basically talking

802
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
everything. It was basically talking
 

803
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,269
everything. It was basically talking
about how every it's like back in the

804
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
about how every it's like back in the
 

805
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,790
about how every it's like back in the
day it used to be that we're like the

806
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
day it used to be that we're like the
 

807
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,110
day it used to be that we're like the
Facebook of X or like we're the Uber of

808
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
Facebook of X or like we're the Uber of
 

809
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,190
Facebook of X or like we're the Uber of
Y and that was what startups were saying

810
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
Y and that was what startups were saying
 

811
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,470
Y and that was what startups were saying
and now everyone's saying we're the

812
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
and now everyone's saying we're the
 

813
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,069
and now everyone's saying we're the
palunteer of X, we're the Palunteer of

814
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
palunteer of X, we're the Palunteer of
 

815
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,990
palunteer of X, we're the Palunteer of
Y. Um, and then this was just a

816
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
Y. Um, and then this was just a
 

817
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,670
Y. Um, and then this was just a
basically a big exploration of like

818
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
basically a big exploration of like
 

819
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,509
basically a big exploration of like
you're not really you're just like a

820
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
you're not really you're just like a
 

821
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,269
you're not really you're just like a
you're you're a services company at this

822
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
you're you're a services company at this
 

823
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,870
you're you're a services company at this
point. Like a lot of a lot of AI

824
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
point. Like a lot of a lot of AI
 

825
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,069
point. Like a lot of a lot of AI
startups um uh frame themselves as being

826
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
startups um uh frame themselves as being
 

827
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,750
startups um uh frame themselves as being
using this fl for deployed engineer

828
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
using this fl for deployed engineer
 

829
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,750
using this fl for deployed engineer
model. Um but they're completely missing

830
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
model. Um but they're completely missing
 

831
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,590
model. Um but they're completely missing
all the things that made make Palanteer

832
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
all the things that made make Palanteer
 

833
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,110
all the things that made make Palanteer
so good such as the industry that it's

834
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
so good such as the industry that it's
 

835
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,110
so good such as the industry that it's
in. There's very very high like there's

836
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
in. There's very very high like there's
 

837
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,550
in. There's very very high like there's
lives at stake on these sort of things.

838
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
lives at stake on these sort of things.
 

839
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,750
lives at stake on these sort of things.
People are willing to pay ridiculous

840
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
People are willing to pay ridiculous
 

841
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,829
People are willing to pay ridiculous
amount of money. Um, and Palanteer has

842
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
amount of money. Um, and Palanteer has
 

843
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,150
amount of money. Um, and Palanteer has
their own uh products and they're very

844
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
their own uh products and they're very
 

845
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,269
their own uh products and they're very
opinionated in the way that they work

846
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
opinionated in the way that they work
 

847
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,550
opinionated in the way that they work
with their clients. It's like you're

848
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
with their clients. It's like you're
 

849
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,670
with their clients. It's like you're
going to pay us a lot of money. We're

850
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
going to pay us a lot of money. We're
 

851
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,430
going to pay us a lot of money. We're
going to set you up on our systems, our

852
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
going to set you up on our systems, our
 

853
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,350
going to set you up on our systems, our
products that we've built and the Ford

854
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
products that we've built and the Ford
 

855
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,269
products that we've built and the Ford
deploys engineers are there to scope

856
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
deploys engineers are there to scope
 

857
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,710
deploys engineers are there to scope
things out, figure out what products

858
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
things out, figure out what products
 

859
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,269
things out, figure out what products
from our bag of products are needed and

860
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
from our bag of products are needed and
 

861
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,110
from our bag of products are needed and
then uh go and actually set them up on

862
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
then uh go and actually set them up on
 

863
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,310
then uh go and actually set them up on
those and do the sort of tricky

864
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
those and do the sort of tricky
 

865
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,389
those and do the sort of tricky
integration works needed. Um, so that's

866
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
integration works needed. Um, so that's
 

867
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,829
integration works needed. Um, so that's
the that's the role of the Ford deployed

868
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
the that's the role of the Ford deployed
 

869
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,430
the that's the role of the Ford deployed
engineer with them and I think that's

870
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
engineer with them and I think that's
 

871
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,110
engineer with them and I think that's
important as an agency going into this.

872
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
important as an agency going into this.
 

873
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,949
important as an agency going into this.
It's not like sure you can afford

874
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
It's not like sure you can afford
 

875
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,509
It's not like sure you can afford
deployed engineer to go and uh use that

876
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
deployed engineer to go and uh use that
 

877
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,350
deployed engineer to go and uh use that
model to to do the audit to get familiar

878
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
model to to do the audit to get familiar
 

879
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,710
model to to do the audit to get familiar
with the business as talking about

880
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
with the business as talking about
 

881
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,670
with the business as talking about
scaling solutions. Uh you've the options

882
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
scaling solutions. Uh you've the options
 

883
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,269
scaling solutions. Uh you've the options
always been to just niche your agency

884
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
always been to just niche your agency
 

885
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,870
always been to just niche your agency
down and say we only solve a certain set

886
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
down and say we only solve a certain set
 

887
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,230
down and say we only solve a certain set
of problems or we work with these these

888
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
of problems or we work with these these
 

889
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,230
of problems or we work with these these
companies only and essentially you are

890
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
companies only and essentially you are
 

891
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,750
companies only and essentially you are
taking that palenty model of building up

892
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
taking that palenty model of building up
 

893
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,069
taking that palenty model of building up
a stack of of like your basket of of

894
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
a stack of of like your basket of of
 

895
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,750
a stack of of like your basket of of
systems that you can sort of hand out to

896
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
systems that you can sort of hand out to
 

897
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,350
systems that you can sort of hand out to
a given niche or to solve a certain

898
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
a given niche or to solve a certain
 

899
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,590
a given niche or to solve a certain
problem. to be looking at where you can

900
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
problem. to be looking at where you can
 

901
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,750
problem. to be looking at where you can
build your own products um and force

902
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
build your own products um and force
 

903
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,069
build your own products um and force
your clients to essentially migrate over

904
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
your clients to essentially migrate over
 

905
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,790
your clients to essentially migrate over
to your system and to be integrated onto

906
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
to your system and to be integrated onto
 

907
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,030
to your system and to be integrated onto
a platform that you've created is really

908
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
a platform that you've created is really
 

909
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,949
a platform that you've created is really
where I think uh the scale comes from

910
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
where I think uh the scale comes from
 

911
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,550
where I think uh the scale comes from
because you start to instead of solving

912
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
because you start to instead of solving
 

913
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,710
because you start to instead of solving
the new problems every single time

914
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
the new problems every single time
 

915
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,590
the new problems every single time
you're able to kind of repeat solve uh

916
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
you're able to kind of repeat solve uh
 

917
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,870
you're able to kind of repeat solve uh
some of the main problems through that

918
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
some of the main problems through that
 

919
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,310
some of the main problems through that
product and the Ford deployed engineer

920
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
product and the Ford deployed engineer
 

921
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,670
product and the Ford deployed engineer
is just getting them set up on it. So

922
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
is just getting them set up on it. So
 

923
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,030
is just getting them set up on it. So
that's an important thing to to put a

924
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
that's an important thing to to put a
 

925
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,710
that's an important thing to to put a
pin in and you can't just run this as

926
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
pin in and you can't just run this as
 

927
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,350
pin in and you can't just run this as
like a a purely completely general

928
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
like a a purely completely general
 

929
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,710
like a a purely completely general
development and consulting agency

930

development and consulting agency
 

931
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,150

because that will still be difficult to

932
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
because that will still be difficult to
 

933
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,470
because that will still be difficult to
scale.

>> Yeah, you will always uh start off as a

>> Yeah, you will always uh start off as a
 

937
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,750
>> Yeah, you will always uh start off as a
generalist but then um as you start to

938
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
generalist but then um as you start to
 

939
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,710
generalist but then um as you start to
grow, you'll get more into the verticals

940
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
grow, you'll get more into the verticals
 

941
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,269
grow, you'll get more into the verticals
that are specific to what the product

942
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
that are specific to what the product
 

943
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,870
that are specific to what the product
needs to be and you'll start to see

944
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
needs to be and you'll start to see
 

945
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,430
needs to be and you'll start to see
those as you grow, which is the best

946
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
those as you grow, which is the best
 

947
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,110
those as you grow, which is the best
part about it. And of course then you

948
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
part about it. And of course then you
 

949
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,470
part about it. And of course then you
can make that choice whether you want to

950
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
can make that choice whether you want to
 

951
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,470
can make that choice whether you want to
go that route or stay in that agency

952
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
go that route or stay in that agency
 

953
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,790
go that route or stay in that agency
route. So at least you have the option.

954
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
route. So at least you have the option.
 

955
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,910
route. So at least you have the option.

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,710
very obvious in in practice but of
course it's very difficult because you

966
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
course it's very difficult because you
 

967
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,949
course it's very difficult because you
have to understand basically the

968
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
have to understand basically the
 

969
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,949
have to understand basically the
business side and why certain things

970
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
business side and why certain things
 

971
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,670
business side and why certain things
exist and so can get into politics and

972
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
exist and so can get into politics and
 

973
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,269
exist and so can get into politics and
other things but you have to figure out

974
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
other things but you have to figure out
 

975
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,990
other things but you have to figure out
a win-win situation for everyone. So, I

976
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
a win-win situation for everyone. So, I
 

977
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,749
a win-win situation for everyone. So, I
think that's probably the echo team's

978
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
think that's probably the echo team's
 

979
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,749
think that's probably the echo team's
job, but if you're in a small agency,

980
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
job, but if you're in a small agency,
 

981
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,189
job, but if you're in a small agency,
then you're going to be doing that side

982
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
then you're going to be doing that side
 

983
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,829
then you're going to be doing that side
of things as well. So, um if you're in

984
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
of things as well. So, um if you're in
 

985
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,710
of things as well. So, um if you're in
front of a decision maker, then one of

986
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
front of a decision maker, then one of
 

987
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,629
front of a decision maker, then one of
the first things you want them to do if

988
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
the first things you want them to do if
 

989
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,150
the first things you want them to do if
they can is build out their business

990
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
they can is build out their business
 

991
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,910
they can is build out their business
hierarchy, like a mind map of their

992
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
hierarchy, like a mind map of their
 

993
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,430
hierarchy, like a mind map of their
business. Um, as well as if you can't

994
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
business. Um, as well as if you can't
 

995
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,269
business. Um, as well as if you can't
get access to things, if they if you

996
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
get access to things, if they if you
 

997
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,749
get access to things, if they if you
have that trust and relationship. um be

998
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
have that trust and relationship. um be
 

999
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,350
have that trust and relationship. um be
able to job shadow some of their

1000
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
able to job shadow some of their
 

1001
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,990
able to job shadow some of their
employees, the very like management, but

1002
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
employees, the very like management, but
 

1003
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,509
employees, the very like management, but
then also employees that are like front

1004
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
then also employees that are like front
 

1005
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,829
then also employees that are like front

So, you're you're getting an idea now of

1010
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
So, you're you're getting an idea now of

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,990
how their business works as a whole, how
they get leads, how they convert those

they get leads, how they convert those
 

1015
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,910
they get leads, how they convert those
leads, how do they maintain those leads,

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
leads, how do they maintain those leads,
 

1017
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,350
leads, how do they maintain those leads,
right? Um how they make

00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
right? Um how they make

Form, don't move them over to Tally,

1084

1085
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,150
Form, don't move them over to Tally,
right? Try to keep it all within the

1086
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
right? Try to keep it all within the
 

1087
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,390
right? Try to keep it all within the
same ecosystem and see if a lot of that

1088
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
same ecosystem and see if a lot of that
 

1089
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,029
same ecosystem and see if a lot of that
stuff will not will be unchanging. So,

1090
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
stuff will not will be unchanging. So,
 

1091
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,270
stuff will not will be unchanging. So,
um even if their brand changes or if

1092
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
um even if their brand changes or if
 

1093

um even if their brand changes or if
their if they decide to uh collect money

1097
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,630
a different way, their industry is still
going to be the same as long as their

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
going to be the same as long as their
 

1099
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,470
going to be the same as long as their
business stay the same, then you can

1100
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
business stay the same, then you can
 

1101
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,390
business stay the same, then you can
still rely on those core technologies.

1102
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
still rely on those core technologies.
 

1103
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,310
still rely on those core technologies.
So, um hence the word data flow. Um, and

1104
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
So, um hence the word data flow. Um, and
 

1105
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,630
So, um hence the word data flow. Um, and
then you can start proposing things that

1106
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
then you can start proposing things that
 

1107
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,909
then you can start proposing things that
will make sense to them.

1108
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
will make sense to them.
 

1109
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,270

understanding what is it they would need

1120
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280

to
 

1123
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,710
to
take their data to the next level. So,

1124
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
take their data to the next level. So,
 

1125
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,789
take their data to the next level. So,
what they were doing was collecting data

1126
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
what they were doing was collecting data
 

1127
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,990

1129
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,310
from uh, Tally, but none of that was
data was being processed. So we decided

1130
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
data was being processed. So we decided
 

1131
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,070
data was being processed. So we decided
that it would be best to build an

that it would be best to build an

using this analogy. It's like when

1148
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
using this analogy. It's like when
 

1149
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,510
using this analogy. It's like when
you're looking for like a roll of tape

1150
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
you're looking for like a roll of tape
 

1151
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,789
you're looking for like a roll of tape
you're like going around trying to find

you're like going around trying to find
 

1153
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,710
you're like going around trying to find
the the edge, right? And so in the audit

1154
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
the the edge, right? And so in the audit
 

1155
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,070
the the edge, right? And so in the audit
you're trying to find that edge. the

1156
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
you're trying to find that edge. the
 

1157
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,190
you're trying to find that edge. the

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
first thing that you can like start

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,190
first thing that you can like start
peeling so that you can get a foot in

00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
peeling so that you can get a foot in
 

1161
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,710
peeling so that you can get a foot in
the door. So, this is just looking at

1162
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
the door. So, this is just looking at
 

1163
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,990
the door. So, this is just looking at
looking at the quick wins that you

1164
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
looking at the quick wins that you
 

1165
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,430
looking at the quick wins that you
identified and going, "Hey, look, we

1166
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
identified and going, "Hey, look, we

Or you stacking a couple in that first

1170
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
Or you stacking a couple in that first
 

1171
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,909
Or you stacking a couple in that first
contract. That's a great analogy cuz

1172
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
contract. That's a great analogy cuz
 

1173
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,230
contract. That's a great analogy cuz
there's if you're looking for that once

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
there's if you're looking for that once
 

1175
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,870
there's if you're looking for that once
you find that piece where the tape ends,

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
you find that piece where the tape ends,
 

1177
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,430
you find that piece where the tape ends,
you're going to actually build a lot of

1178
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
you're going to actually build a lot of
 

1179
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,070
you're going to actually build a lot of
trust in that relationship and you're

1180
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
trust in that relationship and you're
 

1181
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,190
trust in that relationship and you're
going to be able to provide them a lot

1182
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,200
going to be able to provide them a lot
 

1183
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,150
going to be able to provide them a lot
of value up front um right away. So,

1184
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
of value up front um right away. So,
 

1185
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,870
of value up front um right away. So,
it's nothing too daunting. it will be

it's nothing too daunting. it will be
 

1187
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,710
it's nothing too daunting. it will be
and oftentimes you'll have to offer a

1188
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
and oftentimes you'll have to offer a
 

1189
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,470
and oftentimes you'll have to offer a
discount for that first for that first

1190
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
discount for that first for that first
 

1191
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,710
discount for that first for that first
engagement. Um, but that's sort of the

1192
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
engagement. Um, but that's sort of the
 

1193
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,990
engagement. Um, but that's sort of the
risk that you take when you work with

risk that you take when you work with

Yeah, absolutely. You're going to be

00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
Yeah, absolutely. You're going to be
 

1203
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,029
Yeah, absolutely. You're going to be
willing to take a discount on that and

1204
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
willing to take a discount on that and
 

1205
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,549

1211
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,549

bit of money, but if I can land this,

1212
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
bit of money, but if I can land this,
 

1213
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,669
bit of money, but if I can land this,
the amount it's going to do for my

agency and the the length of the the
 

1217
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,750
agency and the the length of the the

a cool little tip is when you're

00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,400
prototype too. Uh, what that do that'll
 

1235
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,990
prototype too. Uh, what that do that'll
do is all business owners like to get

1236
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
do is all business owners like to get
 

1237
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,310
do is all business owners like to get
their wheels spinning. So they like to

1238
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
their wheels spinning. So they like to
 

1239
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,789
their wheels spinning. So they like to
see what the possibilities are before

1240
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
see what the possibilities are before
 

1241
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,669
see what the possibilities are before
they before they buy. So this is

1242
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
they before they buy. So this is
 

1243
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,669
they before they buy. So this is
opportunity for you to actually close

1244
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
opportunity for you to actually close
 

1245
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,230
opportunity for you to actually close
the sale. uh whether just show whe

1246
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
the sale. uh whether just show whe
 

1247
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,710
the sale. uh whether just show whe
whether instead of just emailing them a

1248
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
whether instead of just emailing them a
 

1249
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,909
whether instead of just emailing them a
proposal

1250
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
proposal
 

1251
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,590
proposal
>> and seeing if they reply back, you're

1252
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
>> and seeing if they reply back, you're
 

1253
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,950
>> and seeing if they reply back, you're
actually getting them on the call and

1254
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
actually getting them on the call and
 

1255
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,510
actually getting them on the call and
then closing it there. So we noticed

1256
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
then closing it there. So we noticed
 

1257
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,470
then closing it there. So we noticed
that a lot of actually what we do is

1258
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
that a lot of actually what we do is
 

1259
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,350
that a lot of actually what we do is
pretty reliant on Replet and Zapier and

1260
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
pretty reliant on Replet and Zapier and
 

1261
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,270
pretty reliant on Replet and Zapier and
you can pretty much accomplish a lot of

1262
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
you can pretty much accomplish a lot of
 

1263
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,149
you can pretty much accomplish a lot of
your beginning projects with just those

1264
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
your beginning projects with just those
 

1265
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,830
your beginning projects with just those
two. So you have Replet offering a web

1266
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
two. So you have Replet offering a web
 

1267
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,350
two. So you have Replet offering a web
hook to any API which is crazy. If Zap

1268
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
hook to any API which is crazy. If Zap
 

1269
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,590
hook to any API which is crazy. If Zap
year doesn't have that built in or

1270
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
year doesn't have that built in or
 

1271
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,310
year doesn't have that built in or
make.com or go high level then you can

1272
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
make.com or go high level then you can
 

1273
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,950
make.com or go high level then you can
pass it to replet server. Um we do

1274
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
pass it to replet server. Um we do
 

1275
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,270
pass it to replet server. Um we do
partner with Zapier so we're using a lot

1276
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
partner with Zapier so we're using a lot
 

1277
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,870
partner with Zapier so we're using a lot
of Zapier inhouse as well but this it

1278
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
of Zapier inhouse as well but this it
 

1279
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,029
of Zapier inhouse as well but this it
gives us a lot of options um regarding

1280
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
gives us a lot of options um regarding
 

1281
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,270
gives us a lot of options um regarding
like what we can do with the tools that

1282
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
like what we can do with the tools that
 

1283
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,310
like what we can do with the tools that
we have available to us.

1284
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
we have available to us.
 

1285
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,510
we have available to us.
>> Okay. Yeah. So just walk me through

1286
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
>> Okay. Yeah. So just walk me through
 

1287
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,669
>> Okay. Yeah. So just walk me through
that. You've got a replet web hook

1288
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
that. You've got a replet web hook
 

1289
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,990
that. You've got a replet web hook
dashboard. Give me an example of like

1290
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
dashboard. Give me an example of like
 

1291
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,710
dashboard. Give me an example of like
how this works around a problem that you

1292
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
how this works around a problem that you
 

1293
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,590
how this works around a problem that you
likely to face.

1294
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
likely to face.
 

1295
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,110
likely to face.
>> Yeah. So one of them was Jot Form. So um

1296
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
>> Yeah. So one of them was Jot Form. So um
 

1297
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,870
>> Yeah. So one of them was Jot Form. So um
a client that we used a client that we

1298
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
a client that we used a client that we
 

1299
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,350
a client that we used a client that we
had um used Jot Form but we needed to do

1300
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,360
had um used Jot Form but we needed to do
 

1301
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,110
had um used Jot Form but we needed to do
some hard like pretty heavy duty

1302
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
some hard like pretty heavy duty
 

1303
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,390
some hard like pretty heavy duty
calculations on the form that Jot Form

1304
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
calculations on the form that Jot Form
 

1305
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,029
calculations on the form that Jot Form
didn't do natively even with all the

1306
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039
didn't do natively even with all the
 

1307
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,950
didn't do natively even with all the
plugins and widgets that it had. Zapier

1308
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
plugins and widgets that it had. Zapier
 

1309
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,909
plugins and widgets that it had. Zapier
would not be able to do it either

1310
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
would not be able to do it either
 

1311
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,870
would not be able to do it either
because it would require a lot of

1312
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
because it would require a lot of
 

1313
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,310
because it would require a lot of
looping. So we pass it over to riplet

1314
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
looping. So we pass it over to riplet
 

1315
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,070
looping. So we pass it over to riplet
and riplet was able to actually perform

1316
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
and riplet was able to actually perform
 

1317
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,990
and riplet was able to actually perform
with looping from the payload and then

1318
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
with looping from the payload and then
 

1319
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,710
with looping from the payload and then
pass it pass the data back to zap year

1320
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
pass it pass the data back to zap year
 

1321
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,510
pass it pass the data back to zap year
pre-calculated or already calculated. So

1322
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
pre-calculated or already calculated. So
 

1323
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,470
pre-calculated or already calculated. So
this reduced a lot of firstly costs on

1324
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
this reduced a lot of firstly costs on
 

1325
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,669
this reduced a lot of firstly costs on
the zap tasks but it also reduced a

1326
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
the zap tasks but it also reduced a
 

1327
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,149
the zap tasks but it also reduced a
bottleneck that zap year had which was

1328
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
bottleneck that zap year had which was
 

1329
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,470
bottleneck that zap year had which was
being able to do all all of those

1330
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
being able to do all all of those
 

1331
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,590
being able to do all all of those
calculations at once.

1332
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
calculations at once.
 

1333
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,070
calculations at once.
>> Okay. So it's like this is I mean this

1334
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,080
>> Okay. So it's like this is I mean this
 

1335
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,190
>> Okay. So it's like this is I mean this
is interesting where the where the

1336
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
is interesting where the where the
 

1337
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,270
is interesting where the where the
automation space is going of using

1338
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,280
automation space is going of using
 

1339
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,950
automation space is going of using
custom code to do a lot of the heavy

1340
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
custom code to do a lot of the heavy
 

1341
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,909
custom code to do a lot of the heavy
lifting now that we've got such

1342
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
lifting now that we've got such
 

1343
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,190
lifting now that we've got such
incredible coding models. So you're

1344
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
incredible coding models. So you're
 

1345
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,789
incredible coding models. So you're
saying there's any particularly like

1346
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
saying there's any particularly like
 

1347
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,789
saying there's any particularly like
grunty parts of the the automation.

1348
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
grunty parts of the the automation.
 

1349
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,390
grunty parts of the the automation.
You're just like vibe coding up the

1350
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
You're just like vibe coding up the
 

1351
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,470
You're just like vibe coding up the
automation and then uh making that

1352
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
automation and then uh making that
 

1353
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,630
automation and then uh making that
accessible via web hook in and zap.

1354
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
accessible via web hook in and zap.
 

1355
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,470
accessible via web hook in and zap.
>> Exactly. Yeah. It opens as long as

1356
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480
>> Exactly. Yeah. It opens as long as
 

1357
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,230
>> Exactly. Yeah. It opens as long as
there's an API connection to it or if

1358
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
there's an API connection to it or if
 

1359
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,029
there's an API connection to it or if
there's um if Zap year doesn't already

1360
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
there's um if Zap year doesn't already
 

1361
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,110
there's um if Zap year doesn't already
connect to it then you can you can use

1362
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
connect to it then you can you can use
 

1363
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,390
connect to it then you can you can use
it. Well, during the testing phase,

1364
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
it. Well, during the testing phase,
 

1365
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,390
it. Well, during the testing phase,
you're often looking for edge case

1366
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
you're often looking for edge case
 

1367
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,470
you're often looking for edge case
scenarios. You're looking for errors

1368
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
scenarios. You're looking for errors
 

1369
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,789
scenarios. You're looking for errors
that might crop up, which they will.

1370
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
that might crop up, which they will.
 

1371
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,789
that might crop up, which they will.
You're looking for different SOPs that

1372
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
You're looking for different SOPs that
 

1373
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,310
You're looking for different SOPs that
might happen after the fact. So, let's

1374
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
might happen after the fact. So, let's
 

1375
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,710
might happen after the fact. So, let's
say the customer wants to make edits to

1376
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
say the customer wants to make edits to
 

1377
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,029
say the customer wants to make edits to
it or enhance it or there's things that

1378
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
it or enhance it or there's things that
 

1379
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,950
it or enhance it or there's things that
change on the fly. So, you're accounting

1380
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
change on the fly. So, you're accounting
 

1381
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,470
change on the fly. So, you're accounting
for all those edge cases in the testing

1382
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
for all those edge cases in the testing
 

1383
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,630
for all those edge cases in the testing
phase. So, you're seeing if the

1384
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
phase. So, you're seeing if the
 

1385
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,909
phase. So, you're seeing if the
architecture that you've built is

1386
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
architecture that you've built is
 

1387
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,149
architecture that you've built is
resilient enough to handle these and if

1388
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
resilient enough to handle these and if
 

1389
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,230
resilient enough to handle these and if
possible to build SOPs around it that

1390
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
possible to build SOPs around it that
 

1391
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,070
possible to build SOPs around it that
they can follow to make themselves

1392
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
they can follow to make themselves
 

1393
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,669
they can follow to make themselves
sufficient. And then once you have I

1394
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
sufficient. And then once you have I
 

1395
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,549
sufficient. And then once you have I
would say at least 95% of this ironed

1396
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
would say at least 95% of this ironed
 

1397
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,190
would say at least 95% of this ironed
out then you can hand off and go live.

1398
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
out then you can hand off and go live.
 

1399
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,549
out then you can hand off and go live.
So you would bring it to their side of

1400
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
So you would bring it to their side of
 

1401
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,990
So you would bring it to their side of
the the fence. So you'd be able to have

1402
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
the the fence. So you'd be able to have
 

1403
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,909
the the fence. So you'd be able to have
them sign up for you know Zappier or

1404
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
them sign up for you know Zappier or
 

1405
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,590
them sign up for you know Zappier or
have them sign up for replet and then go

1406
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
have them sign up for replet and then go
 

1407
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,029
have them sign up for replet and then go
ahead and move that code over and then

1408
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
ahead and move that code over and then
 

1409
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,390
ahead and move that code over and then
instantiate it in their in their

1410
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
instantiate it in their in their
 

1411
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,029
instantiate it in their in their
environment. So the next step would be

1412
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
environment. So the next step would be
 

1413
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,510
environment. So the next step would be
after that they test it you get more

1414
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
after that they test it you get more
 

1415
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,110
after that they test it you get more
errors and that's where the support

1416
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
errors and that's where the support
 

1417
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,350
errors and that's where the support
comes in. So support is going to be a

1418
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
comes in. So support is going to be a
 

1419
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,350
comes in. So support is going to be a
lot of I would say doing more of the

1420
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
lot of I would say doing more of the
 

1421
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,350
lot of I would say doing more of the
same thing in the testing phase but

1422
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
same thing in the testing phase but
 

1423
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,950
same thing in the testing phase but
understanding that the scope of work is

1424
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960
understanding that the scope of work is
 

1425
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,070
understanding that the scope of work is
limited to a certain point. So then if

1426
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
limited to a certain point. So then if
 

1427
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,909
limited to a certain point. So then if
it's beyond whatever you guys agreed

1428
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
it's beyond whatever you guys agreed
 

1429
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,830
it's beyond whatever you guys agreed
upon in the proposal then you can start

1430
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,840
upon in the proposal then you can start
 

1431
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,909
upon in the proposal then you can start
building for that. But you do want to

1432
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
building for that. But you do want to
 

1433
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,990
building for that. But you do want to
have you know be good be in good faith

1434
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
have you know be good be in good faith
 

1435
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,549
have you know be good be in good faith
with it. So um don't nickel and dime for

1436
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
with it. So um don't nickel and dime for
 

1437
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,990
with it. So um don't nickel and dime for
everything. You want to be able to at

1438
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
everything. You want to be able to at
 

1439
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,750
everything. You want to be able to at
least say this is beyond sort of the

1440
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
least say this is beyond sort of the
 

1441
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,430
least say this is beyond sort of the
scope of work. this is going to be

1442
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
scope of work. this is going to be
 

1443
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,950
scope of work. this is going to be
another hour for example and then

1444
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
another hour for example and then
 

1445
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,710
another hour for example and then
they'll be able to make that decision

1446
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
they'll be able to make that decision
 

1447
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,270
they'll be able to make that decision
with you.

1448
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:51,280
with you.
 

1449
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,669
with you.
>> Yep. The support's key um and often

1450
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
>> Yep. The support's key um and often
 

1451
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,830
>> Yep. The support's key um and often
often under under scoped for as well. Um

1452
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
often under under scoped for as well. Um
 

1453
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,669
often under under scoped for as well. Um
very easy. I mean the testing is easy to

1454
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
very easy. I mean the testing is easy to
 

1455
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,190
very easy. I mean the testing is easy to
miss in the scope and be like oh yeah we

1456
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
miss in the scope and be like oh yeah we
 

1457
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,630
miss in the scope and be like oh yeah we
just add a couple hours in there for

1458
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,640
just add a couple hours in there for
 

1459
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,789
just add a couple hours in there for
testing. Um if it's something like a

1460
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
testing. Um if it's something like a
 

1461
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,870
testing. Um if it's something like a
voice agent that can take a lot longer.

1462
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
voice agent that can take a lot longer.
 

1463
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,029
voice agent that can take a lot longer.
Um, so this is something we're even like

1464
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039
Um, so this is something we're even like
 

1465
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,470
Um, so this is something we're even like
constantly dealing with at Morningside

1466
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
constantly dealing with at Morningside
 

1467
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,830
constantly dealing with at Morningside
is is how can we we're basically

1468
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
is is how can we we're basically
 

1469
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,830
is is how can we we're basically
increasing prices all the time because

1470
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,840
increasing prices all the time because
 

1471
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,390
increasing prices all the time because
uh it's easy to underestimate the amount

1472
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
uh it's easy to underestimate the amount
 

1473
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,830
uh it's easy to underestimate the amount
of testing involved and then also the

1474
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
of testing involved and then also the
 

1475
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,430
of testing involved and then also the
ongoing support after. So there's

1476
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
ongoing support after. So there's
 

1477
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,430
ongoing support after. So there's
probably a good chance to slot in uh

1478
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
probably a good chance to slot in uh
 

1479
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,149
probably a good chance to slot in uh
just the pricing. So uh say for this

1480
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
just the pricing. So uh say for this
 

1481
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,070
just the pricing. So uh say for this
first build you're scoping it out. And I

1482
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
first build you're scoping it out. And I
 

1483
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,350
first build you're scoping it out. And I
mean, I think for people who are maybe a

1484
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
mean, I think for people who are maybe a
 

1485
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,350
mean, I think for people who are maybe a
little bit confused here, this is like

1486
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
little bit confused here, this is like
 

1487
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,830
little bit confused here, this is like
such a interesting thing to hear from

1488
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:31,840
such a interesting thing to hear from
 

1489
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,510
such a interesting thing to hear from
someone that you literally just walk

1490
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
someone that you literally just walk
 

1491
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,190
someone that you literally just walk
into a business, you shadow people for a

1492
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
into a business, you shadow people for a
 

1493
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,549
into a business, you shadow people for a
bit, you pick one thing that needs

1494
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
bit, you pick one thing that needs
 

1495
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,909
bit, you pick one thing that needs
fixing, and then you build automation

1496
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
fixing, and then you build automation
 

1497
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,029
fixing, and then you build automation
for it. It really is that simple. Um,

1498
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
for it. It really is that simple. Um,
 

1499
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,029
for it. It really is that simple. Um,
and people tend to over complicate it a

1500
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,039
and people tend to over complicate it a
 

1501
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,630
and people tend to over complicate it a
lot because they're like trying to start

1502
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
lot because they're like trying to start
 

1503
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,470
lot because they're like trying to start
off with the most scalable niched offer

1504
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
off with the most scalable niched offer
 

1505
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,149
off with the most scalable niched offer
and find the specific thing. It's like

1506
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
and find the specific thing. It's like
 

1507
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,149
and find the specific thing. It's like
if you come to a company and you say,

1508
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
if you come to a company and you say,
 

1509
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,990
if you come to a company and you say,
"I'm willing to sort of shadow you. I'm

1510
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
"I'm willing to sort of shadow you. I'm
 

1511
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,190
"I'm willing to sort of shadow you. I'm
willing to do the work to get to know

1512
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
willing to do the work to get to know
 

1513
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,950
willing to do the work to get to know
your company." and then we're going to

1514
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
your company." and then we're going to
 

1515
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,870
your company." and then we're going to
start picking off the the best use cases

1516
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
start picking off the the best use cases
 

1517
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,990
start picking off the the best use cases
one by one. It it really can be this

1518
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
one by one. It it really can be this
 

1519
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,230
one by one. It it really can be this
this simple. Um so I think it's a

1520
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
this simple. Um so I think it's a
 

1521
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,230
this simple. Um so I think it's a
refreshing thing for people heading into

1522
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240
refreshing thing for people heading into
 

1523
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,070
refreshing thing for people heading into
2026 to know that this this kind of

1524
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
2026 to know that this this kind of
 

1525
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,750
2026 to know that this this kind of
model does exist whether you're doing it

1526
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
model does exist whether you're doing it
 

1527
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,870
model does exist whether you're doing it
in person or whether you're doing your

1528
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
in person or whether you're doing your
 

1529
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,510
in person or whether you're doing your
audits audits online. Um but I love that

1530
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
audits audits online. Um but I love that
 

1531
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,510
audits audits online. Um but I love that
you can just like streamline it down to

1532
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
you can just like streamline it down to
 

1533
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,990
you can just like streamline it down to
one pretty chunky automation here. Um

1534
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
one pretty chunky automation here. Um
 

1535
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,750
one pretty chunky automation here. Um
whether it's agents or you got voice

1536
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
whether it's agents or you got voice

watching these videos with your
understanding of what AI can do, you've

1632

understanding of what AI can do, you've
 

1633
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,669
understanding of what AI can do, you've
probably got a decent grip of

1634
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
probably got a decent grip of
 

1635
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,070
probably got a decent grip of
automation. You can provide a ton

1636
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,080
automation. You can provide a ton
 

1637
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,390

of value just by taking time to get to
 

1639
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,630
of value just by taking time to get to
know them. And I think it's easy to go

00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
know them. And I think it's easy to go
 

1641
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,230
know them. And I think it's easy to go
into and be kind of scared like, "Oh, am

into and be kind of scared like, "Oh, am

to-in conversational uh, AI system. Um,
 

1689
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,470
to-in conversational uh, AI system. Um,
it's something as basic as like drafting

1690
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
it's something as basic as like drafting
 

1691
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,909
it's something as basic as like drafting
a contract or something. Yeah, I think

1692
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
a contract or something. Yeah, I think
 

1693
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,149
a contract or something. Yeah, I think
one of the big things like you said is

1694
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
one of the big things like you said is
 

1695
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,070
one of the big things like you said is
uh, you may not find anything, but I

1696
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
uh, you may not find anything, but I
 

1697
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,549
uh, you may not find anything, but I
think the confidence in knowing the

1698
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559
think the confidence in knowing the
 

1699
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,909
think the confidence in knowing the
tools and knowing what's out there is

1700
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919
tools and knowing what's out there is
 

1701
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,350
tools and knowing what's out there is
where you're building your skill set.

1702
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,360
where you're building your skill set.
 

1703
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,269
where you're building your skill set.
So, um, as you build your toolbox of

1704
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
So, um, as you build your toolbox of
 

1705
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,269
So, um, as you build your toolbox of
skills and AI and keep up with the the

1706
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279
skills and AI and keep up with the the
 

1707
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,870
skills and AI and keep up with the the
news, you're actually going to find

1708
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
news, you're actually going to find
 

1709
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,350
news, you're actually going to find
something. I'm pretty sure of it and it

1710
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
something. I'm pretty sure of it and it
 

1711
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,750
something. I'm pretty sure of it and it
it is a very nice thing if a customer

1712
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
it is a very nice thing if a customer
 

1713
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,830
it is a very nice thing if a customer
already knows what they want. But, you

1714
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
already knows what they want. But, you
 

1715
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,909
already knows what they want. But, you
know, uh most of the time they're not

1716
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
know, uh most of the time they're not
 

1717
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,269
know, uh most of the time they're not
going to really know what they want or

1718
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:09,279
going to really know what they want or
 

1719
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,870
going to really know what they want or
the thing that they think they want is

1720
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
the thing that they think they want is
 

1721
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,789
the thing that they think they want is
not exactly what is going to provide the

1722
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
not exactly what is going to provide the
 

1723
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,110
not exactly what is going to provide the
most value. And um if you do that,

1724
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
most value. And um if you do that,
 

1725
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,950
most value. And um if you do that,
>> that's the inbound ones. They're often

1726
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
>> that's the inbound ones. They're often
 

1727
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,750
>> that's the inbound ones. They're often
like think they know what they need but

1728
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
like think they know what they need but
 

1729
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,029
like think they know what they need but
and like a lot of the time you're as an

1730
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
and like a lot of the time you're as an
 

1731
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,310
and like a lot of the time you're as an
agency just like okay, I mean they're

1732
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
agency just like okay, I mean they're
 

1733
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,750
agency just like okay, I mean they're
offering to pay me for it. I'll just do

1734
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
offering to pay me for it. I'll just do
 

1735
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,750
offering to pay me for it. I'll just do
it. And those end up being way harder.

1736
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
it. And those end up being way harder.
 

1737
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,510
it. And those end up being way harder.
Like you get a bit of PTSD from trying

1738
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,520
Like you get a bit of PTSD from trying
 

1739
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,669
Like you get a bit of PTSD from trying
to do those builds sometimes. And then

1740
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
to do those builds sometimes. And then
 

1741
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,190
to do those builds sometimes. And then
you realize like how difficult the thing

1742
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
you realize like how difficult the thing
 

1743
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,710
you realize like how difficult the thing
they're asking for here is. And it's

1744
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:32,720
they're asking for here is. And it's
 

1745
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,789
they're asking for here is. And it's
like there's probably six other things

1746
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
like there's probably six other things
 

1747
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,070
like there's probably six other things
that you could have done that were way

1748
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
that you could have done that were way
 

1749
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,909
that you could have done that were way
easier and would provide a much clearer

1750
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
easier and would provide a much clearer
 

1751
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:38,950
easier and would provide a much clearer
ROI.

1752
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:38,960
ROI.
 

1753
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,990
ROI.
>> So it is important.

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,000
>> So it is important.
 

1755
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,389
>> So it is important.
>> Yeah.

1756
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
>> Yeah.
 

1757
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,549
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. 100%. I see there's like three

1758
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
>> Yeah. 100%. I see there's like three
 

1759
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,909
>> Yeah. 100%. I see there's like three
different categories of leads. There's

1760
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:43,919
different categories of leads. There's
 

1761
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,669
different categories of leads. There's
the there's the outbound you reach out

1762
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:45,679
the there's the outbound you reach out
 

1763
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,909
the there's the outbound you reach out
to and they're like kind of on the fence

1764
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:47,919
to and they're like kind of on the fence
 

1765
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,230
to and they're like kind of on the fence
like I don't really I don't know like

1766
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
like I don't really I don't know like
 

1767
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,830
like I don't really I don't know like
you're kind of trying to convince them

1768
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
you're kind of trying to convince them
 

1769
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,590
you're kind of trying to convince them
that they need that they need AI that

1770
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600
that they need that they need AI that
 

1771
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,710
that they need that they need AI that
they need an audit that they need

1772
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
they need an audit that they need
 

1773
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,389
they need an audit that they need
something. And so those are always the

1774
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,399
something. And so those are always the
 

1775
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,310
something. And so those are always the
hardest and most prone to waste your

1776
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,320
hardest and most prone to waste your
 

1777
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,070
hardest and most prone to waste your
time. Then you have the the people who

1778
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
time. Then you have the the people who
 

1779
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,310
time. Then you have the the people who
are maybe coming inbound to you or

1780
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320
are maybe coming inbound to you or
 

1781
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,430
are maybe coming inbound to you or
you've reached out to them and they're

1782
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
you've reached out to them and they're
 

1783
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,710
you've reached out to them and they're
kind of like, "Hey, no, we're ready to

1784
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
kind of like, "Hey, no, we're ready to
 

1785
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,710
kind of like, "Hey, no, we're ready to
do this. I'm curious and like, can we

1786
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
do this. I'm curious and like, can we
 

1787
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,070
do this. I'm curious and like, can we
take our first step?" And that's like a

1788
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
take our first step?" And that's like a
 

1789
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,070
take our first step?" And that's like a
pretty good pocket to be in. Um cuz you

1790
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,080
pretty good pocket to be in. Um cuz you
 

1791
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,350
pretty good pocket to be in. Um cuz you
can start this whole process with them.

1792
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
can start this whole process with them.
 

1793
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,750
can start this whole process with them.
And then there's the uh inbound where

1794
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
And then there's the uh inbound where
 

1795
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,029
And then there's the uh inbound where
they know exactly what they want and

1796
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,039
they know exactly what they want and
 

1797
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,710
they know exactly what they want and
they're like, "I want you to either do

1798
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
they're like, "I want you to either do
 

1799
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,269
they're like, "I want you to either do
this or dive into this area." And so

1800
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,279
this or dive into this area." And so
 

1801
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,269
this or dive into this area." And so
there's three kind of uh pockets of of

1802
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
there's three kind of uh pockets of of
 

1803
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,389
there's three kind of uh pockets of of
leads that you're going to run into as

1804
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
leads that you're going to run into as
 

1805
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,590
leads that you're going to run into as
an agency depending on how you're doing

1806
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,600
an agency depending on how you're doing
 

1807
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,029
an agency depending on how you're doing
your marketing. And it's important to

1808
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
your marketing. And it's important to
 

1809
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,389
your marketing. And it's important to
know the difference between them because

1810
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
know the difference between them because
 

1811
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,830
know the difference between them because
uh you'll end up offering very different

1812
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
uh you'll end up offering very different
 

1813
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,830
uh you'll end up offering very different
services to them. But anyway, let's uh

1814
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
services to them. But anyway, let's uh
 

1815
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,549
services to them. But anyway, let's uh
let's keep it moving.

1816
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:30,559
let's keep it moving.
 

1817
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,750
let's keep it moving.
>> Yeah, I talked a little bit about the

1818
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
>> Yeah, I talked a little bit about the
 

1819
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,430
>> Yeah, I talked a little bit about the
prototype and proposal. There were some

1820
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
prototype and proposal. There were some
 

1821
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,950
prototype and proposal. There were some
proposal considerations that I was going

1822
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
proposal considerations that I was going
 

1823
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,750
proposal considerations that I was going
to mention. So

1824
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
to mention. So
 

1825
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,590
to mention. So
>> just on the prototype, how do you so

1826
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,600
>> just on the prototype, how do you so
 

1827
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,350
>> just on the prototype, how do you so
defining a prototype versus the

1828
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
defining a prototype versus the
 

1829
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,669
defining a prototype versus the
production build? Is this like your we

1830
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
production build? Is this like your we
 

1831
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,510
production build? Is this like your we
call these like PC's. Can we just get

1832
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
call these like PC's. Can we just get
 

1833
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,350
call these like PC's. Can we just get
the core functionality of the build

1834
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
the core functionality of the build
 

1835
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,630
the core functionality of the build
working? Like that's the biggest

1836
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
working? Like that's the biggest
 

1837
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,389
working? Like that's the biggest
question mark. Are you charging for this

1838
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:48,399
question mark. Are you charging for this
 

1839
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,430
question mark. Are you charging for this
this uh this PC? And it's just like say

1840
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,440
this uh this PC? And it's just like say
 

1841
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,190
this uh this PC? And it's just like say
for example it's extracting some

1842
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
for example it's extracting some
 

1843
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,909
for example it's extracting some
information out of a of an image using a

1844
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
information out of a of an image using a
 

1845
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,549
information out of a of an image using a
vision model like the whole build is

1846
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
vision model like the whole build is
 

1847
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,909
vision model like the whole build is
everything out the scaffolding around it

1848
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
everything out the scaffolding around it
 

1849
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,990
everything out the scaffolding around it
the app it's built in the testing and

1850
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
the app it's built in the testing and
 

1851
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,510
the app it's built in the testing and
every like everything else around it is

1852
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
every like everything else around it is
 

1853
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,070
every like everything else around it is
kind of like is a given but it's like

1854
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
kind of like is a given but it's like
 

1855
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,789
kind of like is a given but it's like
can the AI do this one specific thing in

1856
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799
can the AI do this one specific thing in
 

1857
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,389
can the AI do this one specific thing in
it and that's what you're honing in on

1858
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:10,399
it and that's what you're honing in on
 

1859
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,990
it and that's what you're honing in on
in the prototype and and how are you

1860
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
in the prototype and and how are you
 

1861
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,990
in the prototype and and how are you
charging for that? Is that just like a

1862
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
charging for that? Is that just like a
 

1863
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,909
charging for that? Is that just like a
couple grand or just based on the the

1864
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
couple grand or just based on the the
 

1865
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,630
couple grand or just based on the the
estimated hours?

1866
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,640
estimated hours?
 

1867
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,430
estimated hours?

1869
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,549

1871
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,230

1873
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,710

uh free of charge but it often times

1874
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
uh free of charge but it often times

uh free of charge but it often times
does come with a retainer um but this

1876
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
does come with a retainer um but this
 

1877
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,789
does come with a retainer um but this
would be removing a lot of the

1878
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
would be removing a lot of the
 

1879
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,789
would be removing a lot of the
non-negotiables or roadblocks for the

1880
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
non-negotiables or roadblocks for the
 

1881
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,350
non-negotiables or roadblocks for the
proposal. So um if they had said

1882
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360
proposal. So um if they had said
 

1883
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,269
proposal. So um if they had said
something like this is a non-negotiable

1884
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
something like this is a non-negotiable
 

1885
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,190
something like this is a non-negotiable
where let's say in their go high level

1886
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
where let's say in their go high level
 

1887
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,230
where let's say in their go high level
they needed to send from their phone

1888
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,240
they needed to send from their phone
 

1889
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,710
they needed to send from their phone
number without using a Twilio or

1890
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
number without using a Twilio or
 

1891
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,870
number without using a Twilio or
something else. So this would be

1892
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
something else. So this would be
 

1893
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,070
something else. So this would be
something that we research into during

1894
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,080
something that we research into during
 

1895
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,830
something that we research into during
the prototype and if we're able to

1896
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
the prototype and if we're able to
 

1897
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,190
the prototype and if we're able to
remove that roadblock then that could be

1898
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,200
remove that roadblock then that could be
 

1899
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,590
remove that roadblock then that could be
the selling point to it. So we it would

1900
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
the selling point to it. So we it would
 

1901
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,950
the selling point to it. So we it would
be beneficial for us to build out that

1902
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
be beneficial for us to build out that
 

1903
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,149
be beneficial for us to build out that
prototype um within reason. So of course

1904
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,159
prototype um within reason. So of course
 

1905
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,350
prototype um within reason. So of course
a prototype will just be a mere skeleton

1906
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,360
a prototype will just be a mere skeleton
 

1907
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,269
a prototype will just be a mere skeleton
um of what it what it could be or what

1908
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279
um of what it what it could be or what
 

1909
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,710
um of what it what it could be or what
it should be. So it'll almost be 40% of

1910
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
it should be. So it'll almost be 40% of
 

1911
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,190
it should be. So it'll almost be 40% of
the way there.

1912
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,200
the way there.
 

1913
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,549
the way there.

00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
on this though. You've got your your
 

1917
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,510
on this though. You've got your your
audit. You might have scoped that as

1918
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:11,520
audit. You might have scoped that as
 

1919
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,190
audit. You might have scoped that as
look this is going to take I don't know

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
look this is going to take I don't know
 

1921
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,630
look this is going to take I don't know
what like 10 hours and we're going to

1922
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
what like 10 hours and we're going to
 

1923
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,950
what like 10 hours and we're going to
charge like x amount or like 20 hours

1924
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:16,960
charge like x amount or like 20 hours
 

1925
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,029
charge like x amount or like 20 hours
I'm going to charge x amount per hour

1926

I'm going to charge x amount per hour
 

1927
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,789
I'm going to charge x amount per hour
and then after that you're saying here's

1928
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:20,799
and then after that you're saying here's
 

1929
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,149
and then after that you're saying here's
all the opportunities we found here's

00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,159
all the opportunities we found here's
 

1931
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,310
all the opportunities we found here's
what we think we should move on first

1932
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
what we think we should move on first
 

1933
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,389
what we think we should move on first
the cost for a prototype of this so that

1934
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:26,399
the cost for a prototype of this so that
 

1935
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,070
the cost for a prototype of this so that
we can like essentially what we we'd

1936
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
we can like essentially what we we'd
 

1937
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,750
we can like essentially what we we'd
call exploration milestones as well at

1938
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
call exploration milestones as well at
 

1939
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,510
call exploration milestones as well at
morning side it's like let's do an

1940
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,520
morning side it's like let's do an
 

1941
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,149
morning side it's like let's do an
expiration of this let's so we can

1942
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
expiration of this let's so we can
 

1943
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,510
expiration of this let's so we can
properly scope it basically and we'll

1944
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:35,520
properly scope it basically and we'll
 

1945
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,029
properly scope it basically and we'll
give you all the data back on like okay

1946
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039
give you all the data back on like okay
 

1947
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,029
give you all the data back on like okay
yes this non-negotiable is available

1948
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
yes this non-negotiable is available
 

1949
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,029
yes this non-negotiable is available
this this this a little bit of trouble

1950
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
this this this a little bit of trouble
 

1951
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,870
this this this a little bit of trouble
on this last one and this is our main

1952
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
on this last one and this is our main
 

1953
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,110
on this last one and this is our main
concern and that's how you agree on the

1954
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
concern and that's how you agree on the
 

1955
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,830
concern and that's how you agree on the
final scope.

1956
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
final scope.
 

1957
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,870
final scope.
>> Yeah, I think there's a part of it where

1958
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:48,880
>> Yeah, I think there's a part of it where
 

1959
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,870
>> Yeah, I think there's a part of it where
you have to like know that if you're

1960
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
you have to like know that if you're
 

1961
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,149
you have to like know that if you're
going to build it there's a little bit

1962
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:52,159
going to build it there's a little bit
 

1963
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,789
going to build it there's a little bit
of risk involved but usually if let's

1964
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:54,799
of risk involved but usually if let's
 

1965
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,710
of risk involved but usually if let's
say someone were to find a doctor and

1966
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
say someone were to find a doctor and
 

1967
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,710
say someone were to find a doctor and
there that doctor knows everything about

1968
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
there that doctor knows everything about
 

1969
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,310
there that doctor knows everything about
their body and they have their medical

1970
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
their body and they have their medical
 

1971
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,750
their body and they have their medical
records usually they're not going to

1972
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
records usually they're not going to
 

1973
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,470
records usually they're not going to
change doctors. So after we've done the

1974
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480
change doctors. So after we've done the
 

1975
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,909
change doctors. So after we've done the
audit, we've already invested so much

1976
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
audit, we've already invested so much
 

1977
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,070
audit, we've already invested so much
time into them that it would be almost a

1978
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
time into them that it would be almost a
 

1979
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,909
time into them that it would be almost a
disadvantageous for them to go somewhere

1980
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
disadvantageous for them to go somewhere
 

1981
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,590
disadvantageous for them to go somewhere
else but also it relies on the

1982
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
else but also it relies on the
 

1983
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,870
else but also it relies on the
confidence of our team to be able to

1984
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:12,880
confidence of our team to be able to
 

1985
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,269
confidence of our team to be able to
pivot if we need to. So uh there's qu

1986
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:15,279
pivot if we need to. So uh there's qu
 

1987
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,789
pivot if we need to. So uh there's qu
there's like sales tactics we can do you

1988
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
there's like sales tactics we can do you
 

1989
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,630
there's like sales tactics we can do you

what we've done in order to scope this?

2008
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
what we've done in order to scope this?
 

2009
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,110
what we've done in order to scope this?
Uh I I suppose this depends on where you

2010
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
Uh I I suppose this depends on where you
 

2011
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,149
Uh I I suppose this depends on where you
are with your agency. If it's early

2012
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
are with your agency. If it's early
 

2013
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,669
are with your agency. If it's early
stage and you really need to land it,

2014
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:39,679
stage and you really need to land it,
 

2015
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,190
stage and you really need to land it,
you may be willing to do this for free.

2016
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,200
you may be willing to do this for free.
 

2017
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,029
you may be willing to do this for free.
But if you're a bit later stage and you

2018
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
But if you're a bit later stage and you
 

2019
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,310
But if you're a bit later stage and you
might just be like, hey, look, you need

2020
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
might just be like, hey, look, you need
 

2021
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,990
might just be like, hey, look, you need
to pay for this. Is that is that where

2022
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000
to pay for this. Is that is that where
 

2023
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,190
to pay for this. Is that is that where
do you sit on that?

2024
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,200
do you sit on that?
 

2025
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,830
do you sit on that?

2027
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,630
>> I believe with that it it goes longevity
of the business. Um you can start to ask

2028
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,640
of the business. Um you can start to ask
 

2029
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,710
of the business. Um you can start to ask
for a little bit more upfront. I believe

2030
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
for a little bit more upfront. I believe
 

2031
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,909
for a little bit more upfront. I believe
that in the beginning it was a lot of

2032
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
that in the beginning it was a lot of
 

2033
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,470
that in the beginning it was a lot of
free work. I think people try not to do

2034
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,480
free work. I think people try not to do
 

2035
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,990
free work. I think people try not to do
free work, but I think it's inevitable

2036
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,000
free work, but I think it's inevitable
 

2037
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,789
free work, but I think it's inevitable
to do free work for every business. So,

2038
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
to do free work for every business. So,
 

2039
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,070
to do free work for every business. So,
if you're going to start doing this, I

2040
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080
if you're going to start doing this, I
 

2041
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,310
if you're going to start doing this, I
would say don't charge for the prototype

2042
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
would say don't charge for the prototype
 

2043
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,070
would say don't charge for the prototype
because they're going to people are

2044
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
because they're going to people are
 

2045
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,430
because they're going to people are
going to ask like, why am I paying for a

2046
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,440
going to ask like, why am I paying for a
 

2047
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,509
going to ask like, why am I paying for a
prototype? But because you have that

2048
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
prototype? But because you have that
 

2049
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,269
prototype? But because you have that
experience, you have the ability to

2050
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,279
experience, you have the ability to
 

2051
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:15,990
experience, you have the ability to
charge.

2052
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,000
charge.
 

2053
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,909
charge.
>> Yep. Yep. 100%. When you can say, look,

2054
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
>> Yep. Yep. 100%. When you can say, look,
 

2055
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,190
>> Yep. Yep. 100%. When you can say, look,
this is just how we do it. This is how

2056
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
this is just how we do it. This is how
 

2057
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,029
this is just how we do it. This is how
we get results and this makes sure that

2058
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:21,039
we get results and this makes sure that
 

2059
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,950
we get results and this makes sure that
we're all all winning here. um once

2060
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:22,960
we're all all winning here. um once
 

2061
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,230
we're all all winning here. um once
you've got those case studies to back

2062
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
you've got those case studies to back
 

2063
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,630
you've got those case studies to back
you up

2064
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
you up
 

2065
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,990
you up
>> and yeah we pretty much talked about

2066
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
>> and yeah we pretty much talked about
 

2067
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,509
>> and yeah we pretty much talked about
this already this was understanding

2068
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
this already this was understanding
 

2069
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,590
this already this was understanding
their tool stack and seeing how you can

2070
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
their tool stack and seeing how you can
 

2071
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,350
their tool stack and seeing how you can
build that prototype from what they

2072
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,360
build that prototype from what they
 

2073
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,669
build that prototype from what they
already know and this is the u getting

2074
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:33,679
already know and this is the u getting
 

2075
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,870
already know and this is the u getting
the access so understanding the

2076
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
the access so understanding the
 

2077
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,389
the access so understanding the
opportunity matrix this is also part of

2078
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
opportunity matrix this is also part of
 

2079
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,990
opportunity matrix this is also part of
the proposal so we'll go ahead and start

2080
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
the proposal so we'll go ahead and start
 

2081
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,029
the proposal so we'll go ahead and start
here um testing scenarios so I believe

2082
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
here um testing scenarios so I believe
 

2083
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,029
here um testing scenarios so I believe
that building SOPs and documentation is

2084
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039
that building SOPs and documentation is
 

2085
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,269
that building SOPs and documentation is
huge being able to get your client to be

2086
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
huge being able to get your client to be
 

2087
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,389
huge being able to get your client to be
self-sufficient will build that trust um

2088
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
self-sufficient will build that trust um
 

2089
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,750
self-sufficient will build that trust um
and then you can start charging for

2090
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:49,760
and then you can start charging for
 

2091
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,430
and then you can start charging for
support after it reaches the scope of

2092
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
support after it reaches the scope of
 

2093
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,029
support after it reaches the scope of
work one of the things that we really do

2094
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
work one of the things that we really do
 

2095
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,430
work one of the things that we really do
with our clients that they like uh is an

2096
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,440
with our clients that they like uh is an
 

2097
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,909
with our clients that they like uh is an
AI unwrapped report. So every quarter

2098
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:57,919
AI unwrapped report. So every quarter
 

2099
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,350
AI unwrapped report. So every quarter
we'll create a report on like how many

2100
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
we'll create a report on like how many
 

2101
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,830
we'll create a report on like how many
hours they've saved, how many tasks they

2102
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:03,840
hours they've saved, how many tasks they
 

2103
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,389
hours they've saved, how many tasks they
run through Zapier. Um and they can

2104
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
run through Zapier. Um and they can
 

2105
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,430
run through Zapier. Um and they can
actually see it from you know a report

2106
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:09,440
actually see it from you know a report
 

2107
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,430
actually see it from you know a report
like if it's actually been beneficial

2108
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,440
like if it's actually been beneficial
 

2109
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,909
like if it's actually been beneficial
for them. So um it's something that

2110
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
for them. So um it's something that
 

2111
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,669
for them. So um it's something that
we've kind of developed in our own

2112
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
we've kind of developed in our own
 

2113
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,349
we've kind of developed in our own
in-house for our own practice but we

2114
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:17,359
in-house for our own practice but we
 

2115
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,869
in-house for our own practice but we
think it's something that is really

2116
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
think it's something that is really
 

2117
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,349
think it's something that is really
important.

2118
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:19,359
important.
 

2119
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,230
important.
>> Yeah, I love I love this. I think um ROI

2120
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,240
>> Yeah, I love I love this. I think um ROI
 

2121
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,550
>> Yeah, I love I love this. I think um ROI
is way like it's kind of like oh we just

2122
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
is way like it's kind of like oh we just
 

2123
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,109
is way like it's kind of like oh we just
set the automation up agents running and

2124
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
set the automation up agents running and
 

2125
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,190
set the automation up agents running and
sweet sort of job done. But I think as

2126
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
sweet sort of job done. But I think as
 

2127
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,710
sweet sort of job done. But I think as
businesses start to get more and more

2128
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:30,720
businesses start to get more and more
 

2129
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,149
businesses start to get more and more
layers and layers of automation and

2130
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
layers and layers of automation and
 

2131
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,109
layers and layers of automation and
agents and it's like I think imagine how

2132
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:35,119
agents and it's like I think imagine how
 

2133
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,230
agents and it's like I think imagine how
satisfying it's going to be as a

2134
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
satisfying it's going to be as a
 

2135
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,430
satisfying it's going to be as a
business owner. I think in the near

2136
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,440
business owner. I think in the near
 

2137
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,270
business owner. I think in the near
future where you literally have like AI

2138
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,280
future where you literally have like AI
 

2139
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,909
future where you literally have like AI
monitoring all of the oncreen um and

2140
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:41,919
monitoring all of the oncreen um and
 

2141
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,750
monitoring all of the oncreen um and

also you're able to see in real time
 

2151
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,589
also you're able to see in real time
like how many agents are actively

have taken it's like reach out to a lead
 

2185

have taken it's like reach out to a lead
and and qualify them and book them in.

That might have taken after all the

2191
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,829
messing around the CRM might have taken
10 or 15 minutes. Once you can start to

2192
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:35,839
10 or 15 minutes. Once you can start to
 

2193
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,069
10 or 15 minutes. Once you can start to
track those and be like literally like

00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
track those and be like literally like
 

2195

minutes saved, I think that's just going

2196
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,240
minutes saved, I think that's just going
 

2197
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,430
minutes saved, I think that's just going
to feel so empowering as a business

2198
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,440
to feel so empowering as a business
 

2199
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,950
to feel so empowering as a business
owner when you can start to see all of

2201
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,550

these gains stacking up. So I think for

2203
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,750

you going back to the scalability
question, this is something that keeps

2208
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,200
question, this is something that keeps
 

2209
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,270
question, this is something that keeps
them around, right? like having a report

2210
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,280
them around, right? like having a report
 

2211
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,430
them around, right? like having a report
each quarter that updates them and being

each quarter that updates them and being
 

2213
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,030
each quarter that updates them and being
like, "Hey, look, we are monitoring the

2214
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040
like, "Hey, look, we are monitoring the
 

2215
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,710
like, "Hey, look, we are monitoring the

this is how much our our investments

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,310
this is how much our our investments
returned on us returned us so far. We

returned on us returned us so far. We
 

2227
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,390
returned on us returned us so far. We
can we want to back the back the truck

2228
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:10,400
can we want to back the back the truck
 

2229
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,750
can we want to back the back the truck

So, I think this is a genius thing to

2232
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
So, I think this is a genius thing to
 

2233
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,630
So, I think this is a genius thing to
do, man. And uh more of us should be

2234
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
do, man. And uh more of us should be
 

2235
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:14,950
do, man. And uh more of us should be
doing it.

2236
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:14,960
doing it.
 

2237
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,710
doing it.
>> Scaling R and product building. So

2238
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720
>> Scaling R and product building. So

essentially what we decided was it would

2240
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
essentially what we decided was it would
 

2241
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,270
essentially what we decided was it would
be best if we moved away from the

2242
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
be best if we moved away from the
 

2243
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,230
be best if we moved away from the
demystify AI LLC model that we moved

2244
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,240
demystify AI LLC model that we moved
 

2245
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,230
demystify AI LLC model that we moved
into something uh that was more

2246
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,240
into something uh that was more
 

2247
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,030
into something uh that was more
productized. So we created a C corp

2248
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,040
productized. So we created a C corp
 

2249
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,069
productized. So we created a C corp
called dataf flow pros and this is where

2250
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:32,079
called dataf flow pros and this is where
 

2251
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,990
called dataf flow pros and this is where
we actually do a lot of our service-

2252
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000
we actually do a lot of our service-
 

2253
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,430
we actually do a lot of our service-
based business under. So um a couple of

2254
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
based business under. So um a couple of
 

2255
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,829
based business under. So um a couple of
benefits to that is that it's niche and

2256
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
benefits to that is that it's niche and
 

2257
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,990
benefits to that is that it's niche and
it's vertical to the industries that

2258
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
it's vertical to the industries that
 

2259
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,470
it's vertical to the industries that
we've been working with but also um it

2260
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:44,480
we've been working with but also um it
 

2261
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,550
we've been working with but also um it
is a core entity. So it allows for

2262
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:46,560
is a core entity. So it allows for
 

2263
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,190
is a core entity. So it allows for
funding and investors to come in to

00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
funding and investors to come in to
 

2265
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,950
funding and investors to come in to
essentially look at a product and see a

2266
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
essentially look at a product and see a
 

2267
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,550
essentially look at a product and see a
pitch deck and invest.

all fit together as well with this

2378
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
all fit together as well with this
 

2379
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,630
all fit together as well with this
>> there's more so building like legally

2380
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:50,640

binding contracts to our clients

2382
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440
binding contracts to our clients
 

2383
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,270
binding contracts to our clients
to um formally instantiate that

2384
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,280
to um formally instantiate that
 

2385
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,150
to um formally instantiate that
partnership. So it almost makes them

2386
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,160
partnership. So it almost makes them
 

2387
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,190
partnership. So it almost makes them
almost part of our portfolio as um

2388
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,200
almost part of our portfolio as um
 

2389
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,190
almost part of our portfolio as um
shareholders in our in our data flow

2390
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
shareholders in our in our data flow
 

2391
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,190
shareholders in our in our data flow
pros company. So I think that's more of

2392
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
pros company. So I think that's more of
 

2393
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,990
pros company. So I think that's more of
a powerful uh relationship than is just

2394
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,000
a powerful uh relationship than is just
 

2395
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,630
a powerful uh relationship than is just
them paying us per month. So it gives

2396
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:12,640
them paying us per month. So it gives
 

2397
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,630
them paying us per month. So it gives
some sort of return at the end and

2398
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:14,640
some sort of return at the end and
 

2399
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,390
some sort of return at the end and
they're realizing that this is not just

2400
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,400
they're realizing that this is not just
 

2401
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,069
they're realizing that this is not just
a company that's going to go away and

2402
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,079
a company that's going to go away and
 

2403
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,870
a company that's going to go away and
that they can rely on us for any other

2404
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:20,880
that they can rely on us for any other
 

2405
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,950
that they can rely on us for any other
solutions. We don't have like C corps in

2406
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:22,960
solutions. We don't have like C corps in
 

2407
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,870
solutions. We don't have like C corps in
uh in New Zealand as far like we don't

2408
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:24,880
uh in New Zealand as far like we don't
 

2409
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,710
uh in New Zealand as far like we don't
really have the same. So explain it to a

2410
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:26,720
really have the same. So explain it to a
 

2411
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,069
really have the same. So explain it to a
non- US resident citizen. Um how this

2412
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
non- US resident citizen. Um how this
 

2413
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,990
non- US resident citizen. Um how this
differs from just any other kind of

2414
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,000
differs from just any other kind of
 

2415
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,390
differs from just any other kind of
company.

2416
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
company.
 

2417
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,829
company.
>> Yeah. So we have a couple different

2418
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:33,839
>> Yeah. So we have a couple different
 

2419
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,950
>> Yeah. So we have a couple different
structures. You have an LLC, UFC corp, S

2420
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
structures. You have an LLC, UFC corp, S
 

2421
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,829
structures. You have an LLC, UFC corp, S
corps, but unfortunately LLC's uh are

2422
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:39,839
corps, but unfortunately LLC's uh are
 

2423
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,950
corps, but unfortunately LLC's uh are
not able to be funded. They don't have

2424
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
not able to be funded. They don't have
 

2425
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,750
not able to be funded. They don't have
the idea of shares don't exist in LLC's.

2426
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:45,760
the idea of shares don't exist in LLC's.
 

2427
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,310
the idea of shares don't exist in LLC's.
Um so ownership is seen differently. Um

2428
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:48,320
Um so ownership is seen differently. Um
 

2429
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,710
Um so ownership is seen differently. Um
in C corps you do have uh board of

2430
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:50,720
in C corps you do have uh board of
 

2431
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,150
in C corps you do have uh board of
directors, shares um shareholders and

2432
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,160
directors, shares um shareholders and
 

2433
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,829
directors, shares um shareholders and
stocks. So those can become uh IPOed

2434
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
stocks. So those can become uh IPOed
 

2435
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,870
stocks. So those can become uh IPOed
type businesses. So the idea for a C

2436
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
type businesses. So the idea for a C
 

2437
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,990
type businesses. So the idea for a C
corp is to actually garner investors. So

2438
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
corp is to actually garner investors. So
 

2439
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,390
corp is to actually garner investors. So
if you ever see someone uh in Y

2440
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:06,400
if you ever see someone uh in Y
 

2441
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,710
if you ever see someone uh in Y
cominator or if you go to crunchbase and

2442
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:08,720
cominator or if you go to crunchbase and
 

2443
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,550
cominator or if you go to crunchbase and
you look up a company, most more often

2444
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:10,560
you look up a company, most more often
 

2445
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,829
you look up a company, most more often
not they're going to be C corp or S

2446

longest where you really like you
understand that industry just as well if

2602

understand that industry just as well if
 

2603
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,710
understand that industry just as well if
not better than better than them in

2604
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
not better than better than them in
 

2605
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,870
not better than better than them in
terms of like how how the the businesses

2606
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
terms of like how how the the businesses
 

2607

technical standpoint. So if you're not
 

2611
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,670
technical standpoint. So if you're not
willing to go through that tough period

2612
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
willing to go through that tough period

kind of general uh not feeling super
 

2617
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,390
kind of general uh not feeling super
scalable, you're not going to get to the

2618

scalable, you're not going to get to the
 

2619

scalable, you're not going to get to the
point where you can have one of these

2620
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
point where you can have one of these
 

2621
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,829
point where you can have one of these
long-term clients that really can reveal

2622

this uh I mean just do the d do the
 

2639
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,270
this uh I mean just do the d do the
tough work um until you find that

2640
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,280
tough work um until you find that
 

2641
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,349
tough work um until you find that
opportunity because it doesn't happen

2642
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
opportunity because it doesn't happen
 

2643
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,710
opportunity because it doesn't happen
overnight I can tell you that much

2644
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,720
overnight I can tell you that much
 

2645
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,150
overnight I can tell you that much
>> yeah you have to reframe your idea of

2646
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,160
>> yeah you have to reframe your idea of
 

2647
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,870
>> yeah you have to reframe your idea of
what long-term means and um instant

2648
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
what long-term means and um instant
 

2649
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,109
what long-term means and um instant
gratification is not something that this

2650
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:33,119
gratification is not something that this
 

2651
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,109
gratification is not something that this
is this is not instant gratification

2652
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:35,119
is this is not instant gratification
 

2653
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,710
is this is not instant gratification
model uh it's providing value and being

2654
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:38,720
model uh it's providing value and being
 

2655
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,670
model uh it's providing value and being
fulfilled every okay, doing what you do

2656
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:41,680
fulfilled every okay, doing what you do
 

2657
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,190
fulfilled every okay, doing what you do
and then with the hopes of having a

2658
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
and then with the hopes of having a
 

2659
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,069
and then with the hopes of having a
product, but maybe maybe we don't find a

2660
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
product, but maybe maybe we don't find a
 

2661
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,069
product, but maybe maybe we don't find a
product. So, it's it's really about

2662
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
product. So, it's it's really about
 

2663
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,670
product. So, it's it's really about
trusting the companies that you're with

2664
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
trusting the companies that you're with
 

2665
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,750
trusting the companies that you're with
and building those relationships and

2666
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:51,760
and building those relationships and
 

2667
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,630
and building those relationships and
having fun while doing it. So, um I

2668
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:54,640
having fun while doing it. So, um I
 

2669
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,150
having fun while doing it. So, um I
don't think it's for everybody, but I

2670
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
don't think it's for everybody, but I
 

2671
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,910
don't think it's for everybody, but I
think for the people who do find the FD

2672
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
think for the people who do find the FD
 

2673
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,069
think for the people who do find the FD
model, they're going to find out that it

2674
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
model, they're going to find out that it
 

2675
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,510
model, they're going to find out that it
does bring a lot of purpose and meaning

2676
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
does bring a lot of purpose and meaning
 

2677
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,150
does bring a lot of purpose and meaning
to life. And so, um I encourage everyone

2678
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,160
to life. And so, um I encourage everyone
 

2679
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,309
to life. And so, um I encourage everyone
to at least try it and put themselves

2680
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319
to at least try it and put themselves
 

2681
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,030
to at least try it and put themselves
out there. And um it will be a lot of

2682
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:09,040
out there. And um it will be a lot of
 

2683
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,069
out there. And um it will be a lot of
learning. You're going to up your skills

2684
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,079
learning. You're going to up your skills
 

2685
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,589
learning. You're going to up your skills
and at the end of the day there's a lot

2686
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:11,599
and at the end of the day there's a lot
 

2687
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,550
and at the end of the day there's a lot
of jobs that uh are FTE jobs that are

2688
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:14,560
of jobs that uh are FTE jobs that are
 

2689
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,829
of jobs that uh are FTE jobs that are
coming out. So you can easily get

2690
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
coming out. So you can easily get
 

2691
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,190
coming out. So you can easily get
something like that and it pays really

2692
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
something like that and it pays really
 

2693
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,589
something like that and it pays really
well.

2694
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:17,599
well.
 

2695
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,950
well.
>> Interesting thing on this is that when

2696
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
>> Interesting thing on this is that when
 

2697
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,390
>> Interesting thing on this is that when
you look at like the most the guys who

2698
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
you look at like the most the guys who
 

2699
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,470
you look at like the most the guys who
are like scaling their AI agencies the

2700
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:22,480
are like scaling their AI agencies the
 

2701
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,510
are like scaling their AI agencies the
hardest. They've niched down to

2702
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
hardest. They've niched down to
 

2703
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,190
hardest. They've niched down to
something like AI lead genen that like

2704
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,200
something like AI lead genen that like
 

2705
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,710
something like AI lead genen that like
every business needs this. They've done

2706
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
every business needs this. They've done
 

2707
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,510
every business needs this. They've done
like AI lead gen 4x like that that was

2708
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
like AI lead gen 4x like that that was
 

2709
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,109
like AI lead gen 4x like that that was
already a like lead gen was already a

2710
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
already a like lead gen was already a
 

2711
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,150
already a like lead gen was already a
business. They've just kind of like

2712
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
business. They've just kind of like
 

2713
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,069
business. They've just kind of like
strapped AI onto it. Of course, it's

2714
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
strapped AI onto it. Of course, it's
 

2715
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,390
strapped AI onto it. Of course, it's
going to be a lot more scalable, but

2716
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:36,400
going to be a lot more scalable, but
 

2717
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,150
going to be a lot more scalable, but
they I feel like they're trading in the

2718
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
they I feel like they're trading in the
 

2719
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,910
they I feel like they're trading in the
the short term for the long term because

2720
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:39,920
the short term for the long term because
 

2721
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,270
the short term for the long term because
like you're going to go into logistics

2722
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,280
like you're going to go into logistics
 

2723
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,190
like you're going to go into logistics
and find some incredible product idea

2724
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,200
and find some incredible product idea
 

2725
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,270
and find some incredible product idea
and make $100 million and they're just

2726
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
and make $100 million and they're just
 

2727
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,030
and make $100 million and they're just
going to make like 100 grand, 200 grand

2728
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,040
going to make like 100 grand, 200 grand
 

2729
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,430
going to make like 100 grand, 200 grand
a month with their AI legion agency and

2730
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:49,440
a month with their AI legion agency and
 

2731
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,550
a month with their AI legion agency and
they're going to find an opportunity,

2732
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,560
they're going to find an opportunity,
 

2733
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,870
they're going to find an opportunity,
but like it's nothing that revolutionary

2734
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:52,880
but like it's nothing that revolutionary
 

2735
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,470
but like it's nothing that revolutionary
about like there's going to be so many

2736
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
about like there's going to be so many
 

2737
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,950
about like there's going to be so many
AI lead genen related like that whole

2738
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:56,960
AI lead genen related like that whole
 

2739
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,630
AI lead genen related like that whole
pipeline is pretty much standardized.

2740
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,640
pipeline is pretty much standardized.
 

2741
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,910
pipeline is pretty much standardized.
Like you're just putting AI in a

2742
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
Like you're just putting AI in a
 

2743
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,109
Like you're just putting AI in a
different piece of the puzzle. It's like

2744
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
different piece of the puzzle. It's like
 

2745
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,790
different piece of the puzzle. It's like
conversational AI pipeline to catch

2746
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
conversational AI pipeline to catch
 

2747
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,710
conversational AI pipeline to catch
things that fall through the cracks that

2748
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720

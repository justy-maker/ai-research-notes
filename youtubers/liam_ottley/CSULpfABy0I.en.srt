clients. One of the easiest ways to
 

163
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,990
clients. One of the easiest ways to
start out and actually find clients to

164
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
start out and actually find clients to
 

165
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,830
start out and actually find clients to
work with is on platforms like Upwork or

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
stuff built, but they don't have the
 

175
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,830

time to learn the tools themselves. So,

176
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
time to learn the tools themselves. So,
 

177
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,750

it going is medium, and the earning
 

187
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,830
it going is medium, and the earning
potential is low to medium. This path of

188
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
potential is low to medium. This path of
 

189
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,350
potential is low to medium. This path of
learning to build is also covered in the

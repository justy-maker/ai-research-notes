00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,320
The future of AI assistance is here and
 

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,830
The future of AI assistance is here and
it's not from Anthropic. It's not from

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
it's not from Anthropic. It's not from
 

5
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,910
it's not from Anthropic. It's not from
OpenAI. It's not even from Google. It's

6
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
OpenAI. It's not even from Google. It's
 

7
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,510
OpenAI. It's not even from Google. It's
from a little open source app called

8
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
from a little open source app called
 

9
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,350
from a little open source app called
Claudebot which has taken the internet

10
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
Claudebot which has taken the internet
 

11
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,350
Claudebot which has taken the internet
by storm. It is by far one of the most

12
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
by storm. It is by far one of the most
 

13
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,509
by storm. It is by far one of the most
powerful AI tools I have ever seen. And

14
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
powerful AI tools I have ever seen. And
 

15
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,709
powerful AI tools I have ever seen. And
so in this video, we're going to be

16
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
so in this video, we're going to be
 

17
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,870
so in this video, we're going to be
breaking down what it is, how it works,

18
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
breaking down what it is, how it works,
 

19
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,310
breaking down what it is, how it works,
the dangers and risks that you need to

20
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
the dangers and risks that you need to
 

21
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,990
the dangers and risks that you need to
be aware of before diving in, and most

22
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
be aware of before diving in, and most
 

23
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,830
be aware of before diving in, and most
importantly, the top three ways to start

24
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
importantly, the top three ways to start
 

25
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,670
importantly, the top three ways to start
printing money with this before everyone

26
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
printing money with this before everyone
 

27
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,189
printing money with this before everyone
else catches on. Plus, I'm going to be

28
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
else catches on. Plus, I'm going to be
 

29
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,790
else catches on. Plus, I'm going to be
giving away my free guide on how to get

now in the Javas era of AI and uh we're

38
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
now in the Javas era of AI and uh we're
 

39
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,950
now in the Javas era of AI and uh we're
going to break it down here for you

40
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
going to break it down here for you
 

41
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,110
going to break it down here for you
guys. Not only what Claudebot is, how

42
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
guys. Not only what Claudebot is, how
 

43
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,790
guys. Not only what Claudebot is, how
significant this is, and how it's really

44
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
significant this is, and how it's really
 

45
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,110
significant this is, and how it's really
an entirely new market opening up for

46
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
an entirely new market opening up for
 

47
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,389
an entirely new market opening up for
making money and building businesses,

48
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
making money and building businesses,
 

49
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,670
making money and building businesses,
which we'll get into, but more

50
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
which we'll get into, but more
 

51
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,190
which we'll get into, but more
importantly, like how to set this thing

52
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
importantly, like how to set this thing
 

53
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,110
importantly, like how to set this thing
up, how it actually works, um so you

54
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
up, how it actually works, um so you
 

55
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,389
up, how it actually works, um so you
guys can figure it out and start moving

56
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
guys can figure it out and start moving
 

57
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,229
guys can figure it out and start moving
on it now because it is really taken

58
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
on it now because it is really taken
 

59
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,830
on it now because it is really taken
off. So, Mark, thanks for coming on,

60
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
off. So, Mark, thanks for coming on,
 

61
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,630
off. So, Mark, thanks for coming on,
mate. What are we going to be going

62
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
mate. What are we going to be going
 

63
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,990
mate. What are we going to be going
through here? All right. So, I'm going

64
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
through here? All right. So, I'm going
 

65
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,990
through here? All right. So, I'm going
to walk through how Claudebot works and

66
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
to walk through how Claudebot works and
 

67
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,069
to walk through how Claudebot works and
what it is. So, you have Claude Code,

68
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
what it is. So, you have Claude Code,
 

69
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,750
what it is. So, you have Claude Code,
which the world, including myself, have

70
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
which the world, including myself, have
 

71
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,389
which the world, including myself, have
gone pretty insane over. Claudebot is

72
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
gone pretty insane over. Claudebot is
 

73
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,869
gone pretty insane over. Claudebot is
like a brain that's not necessarily on a

74
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
like a brain that's not necessarily on a
 

75
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,910
like a brain that's not necessarily on a
terminal. So, you don't have to

76
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
terminal. So, you don't have to
 

77
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,310
terminal. So, you don't have to
interface with Claudebot on that boring

78
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
interface with Claudebot on that boring
 

79
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,270
interface with Claudebot on that boring
terminal. And you don't have to use

80
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
terminal. And you don't have to use
 

81
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,350
terminal. And you don't have to use
something like co-work either. So, you

82
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
something like co-work either. So, you
 

83
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,190
something like co-work either. So, you
can use whatever input you want. It

84
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
can use whatever input you want. It
 

85
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,270
can use whatever input you want. It
could be a Telegram message, a WhatsApp

86
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
could be a Telegram message, a WhatsApp
 

87
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,070
could be a Telegram message, a WhatsApp
message, Slack, Discord. You have so

88
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
message, Slack, Discord. You have so
 

89
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,230
message, Slack, Discord. You have so
many options on how you interface with

90
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
many options on how you interface with
 

91
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,230
many options on how you interface with
it. And even though it's called

92
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
it. And even though it's called
 

93
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,789
it. And even though it's called
Claudebot, you can actually use whatever

94
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
Claudebot, you can actually use whatever
 

95
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,469
Claudebot, you can actually use whatever
language model you want. So it's meant

96
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
language model you want. So it's meant
 

97
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,550
language model you want. So it's meant
to be air traffic control where you get

98
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
to be air traffic control where you get
 

99
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,789
to be air traffic control where you get
the message and depending on what tools

100
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
the message and depending on what tools
 

101
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,270
the message and depending on what tools
and skills it has, it can talk to you

102
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
and skills it has, it can talk to you
 

103
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,190
and skills it has, it can talk to you
like a chatbot. It can work like an

104
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
like a chatbot. It can work like an
 

105
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,950
like a chatbot. It can work like an
agent. And most importantly, you can

106
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
agent. And most importantly, you can
 

107
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,350
agent. And most importantly, you can
tell it to be proactive. So if you're

108
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
tell it to be proactive. So if you're
 

109
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,510
tell it to be proactive. So if you're
Liam, tell me about the top 10 trends

110
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
Liam, tell me about the top 10 trends
 

111
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,670
Liam, tell me about the top 10 trends
happening in AI right now. What would be

112
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
happening in AI right now. What would be
 

113
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,830
happening in AI right now. What would be
the most important for my audience? Then

114
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
the most important for my audience? Then
 

115
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,590
the most important for my audience? Then
instead of just answering your questions

116
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
instead of just answering your questions
 

117
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,590
instead of just answering your questions
or doing the thing like claude code

118
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
or doing the thing like claude code
 

119
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,749
or doing the thing like claude code
would do, it can do the thing, it can be

120
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
would do, it can do the thing, it can be
 

121
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,990
would do, it can do the thing, it can be
proactive and do something else later or

122
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
proactive and do something else later or
 

123
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,990
proactive and do something else later or
come up with something on its own later.

124
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
come up with something on its own later.
 

125
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,149
come up with something on its own later.
So this is kind of freeing what you guys

126
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
So this is kind of freeing what you guys
 

127
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,590
So this is kind of freeing what you guys
may be familiar with the the

128
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
may be familiar with the the
 

129
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,429
may be familiar with the the
functionality of of clawed code. We're

130
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
functionality of of clawed code. We're
 

131
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,109
functionality of of clawed code. We're
basically like jailbreaking it, freeing

132
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
basically like jailbreaking it, freeing
 

133
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,270
basically like jailbreaking it, freeing
it from uh being stuck on your desktop

134
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
it from uh being stuck on your desktop
 

135
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,109
it from uh being stuck on your desktop
or playing uh accessing it through a

136
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
or playing uh accessing it through a
 

137
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,430
or playing uh accessing it through a
command line. We can now set up a a

138
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
command line. We can now set up a a
 

139
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,029
command line. We can now set up a a
telegram bot that we can message

140
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
telegram bot that we can message
 

141
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,030
telegram bot that we can message
directly. So, whenever you're on the go,

142
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
directly. So, whenever you're on the go,
 

143
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,790
directly. So, whenever you're on the go,
um, in Mark's case, he's bought a Mac

144
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
um, in Mark's case, he's bought a Mac
 

145
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,390
um, in Mark's case, he's bought a Mac
Mini to set this up on, but as we're

146
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
Mini to set this up on, but as we're
 

147
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,510
Mini to set this up on, but as we're
going to go into, there's other options

148
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
going to go into, there's other options
 

149
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,270
going to go into, there's other options
as well, but it's basically setting up

150
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
as well, but it's basically setting up
 

151
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,190
as well, but it's basically setting up
your own special version of Claude code

152
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
your own special version of Claude code
 

153
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,710
your own special version of Claude code
that has access to a bunch of files and

154
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
that has access to a bunch of files and
 

155
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,309
that has access to a bunch of files and
more importantly combining these skills

156
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
more importantly combining these skills
 

157
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,910
more importantly combining these skills
in there as well that allows you to

158
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
in there as well that allows you to
 

159
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,430
in there as well that allows you to
access it from wherever you want. Um,

160
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
access it from wherever you want. Um,
 

161
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,869
access it from wherever you want. Um,
and this is a massive leap in the right

162
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
and this is a massive leap in the right
 

163
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,589
and this is a massive leap in the right
direction towards uh, like the Javas AI

00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
direction towards uh, like the Javas AI
 

165
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,790
direction towards uh, like the Javas AI
that we're all kind of dreaming of.

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
that we're all kind of dreaming of.

care? because this has gone viral
 

175
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,350
care? because this has gone viral
because it's the first time you actually

176
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
because it's the first time you actually
 

177
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,190
because it's the first time you actually
have a personal assistant that you can

178
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
have a personal assistant that you can
 

179
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,830
have a personal assistant that you can
truly configure and you don't need edit,

180
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
truly configure and you don't need edit,
 

181
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,509
truly configure and you don't need edit,
you don't need m.com, you don't need a

182
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
you don't need m.com, you don't need a
 

183
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,350
you don't need m.com, you don't need a
100 node workflow. You can literally

184
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
100 node workflow. You can literally
 

185
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,949
100 node workflow. You can literally
just as soon as you install it and you

186
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
just as soon as you install it and you
 

187
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,190
just as soon as you install it and you
can go back and forth with any AI to

188
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
can go back and forth with any AI to
 

189
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,030
can go back and forth with any AI to
help you, you can build pretty much

190
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
help you, you can build pretty much
 

191
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,470
help you, you can build pretty much
whatever you want. So this is the

192
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
whatever you want. So this is the
 

193
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,710
whatever you want. So this is the
beginning of the personal assistant era.

194
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
beginning of the personal assistant era.
 

195
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,229
beginning of the personal assistant era.
This is the whole like the future is

This is the whole like the future is
 

197
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,350
This is the whole like the future is
already here. It's just not evenly

198
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
already here. It's just not evenly
 

199
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,110

same thing. But there's a big difference
between this and voice flow because the

passing were huge edit workflows just
 

259
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,830

four or five months ago. And now it's
 

261

of reach financially either for you or
your clients. You can run a local model

270
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
your clients. You can run a local model
 

271
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,150
your clients. You can run a local model
and then have that hooked up to this

272
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
and then have that hooked up to this
 

273
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,550
and then have that hooked up to this

what happens when, which tools are used,
 

279
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,469
what happens when, which tools are used,
and which skills are needed. Yeah, I

280
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
and which skills are needed. Yeah, I
 

281
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,749
and which skills are needed. Yeah, I
mean the the quickest thing you could do

282
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
mean the the quickest thing you could do
 

283
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,270
mean the the quickest thing you could do
to cut your cost is jump over to some of

284
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
to cut your cost is jump over to some of
 

285
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,710
to cut your cost is jump over to some of
the the Google models, you know, like go

286
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
the the Google models, you know, like go
 

287
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,790
the the Google models, you know, like go
from using Opus 4.5 to anything in the

288
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
from using Opus 4.5 to anything in the
 

289
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,909
from using Opus 4.5 to anything in the
Google suite. Uh far far cheaper than uh

290
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
Google suite. Uh far far cheaper than uh
 

291
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,670
Google suite. Uh far far cheaper than uh
than the anthropic ones. So there's

292
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
than the anthropic ones. So there's
 

293
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,909
than the anthropic ones. So there's
that. Or I mean if you're really trying

294
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
that. Or I mean if you're really trying
 

295
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,350
that. Or I mean if you're really trying
to minimize cost, it would be the Google

296
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
to minimize cost, it would be the Google
 

297
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,710
to minimize cost, it would be the Google
side, right? Rather than having to

298
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
side, right? Rather than having to
 

299
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,310
side, right? Rather than having to

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
for me and I've got a pretty decent Mac
 

309
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,230
for me and I've got a pretty decent Mac
and it was just like it took 40 minutes

310
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
and it was just like it took 40 minutes
 

311
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,230
and it was just like it took 40 minutes
to generate like 3,500 tokens or

312
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
to generate like 3,500 tokens or
 

313
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,150
to generate like 3,500 tokens or
something. So yeah, there is definitely

314
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
something. So yeah, there is definitely
 

315
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,909
something. So yeah, there is definitely
a hardware limitation so people need to

316
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
a hardware limitation so people need to
 

317
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,550
a hardware limitation so people need to
be aware of that.

318
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
be aware of that.
 

319
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,030
be aware of that.
>> Yeah, it's a good segue. So the ways you

320
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,040
>> Yeah, it's a good segue. So the ways you
 

321
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,310
>> Yeah, it's a good segue. So the ways you
can use and set up Cloudbot, like we

322
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
can use and set up Cloudbot, like we
 

323
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,390
can use and set up Cloudbot, like we
said, you don't need a Mac Mini. The

324
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
said, you don't need a Mac Mini. The
 

325
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,029
said, you don't need a Mac Mini. The
TLDDR of why people like myself have

326
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
TLDDR of why people like myself have
 

327
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,670
TLDDR of why people like myself have
gone one is if you want to have that

328
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
gone one is if you want to have that
 

329
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,189
gone one is if you want to have that
interface where you can physically see

330
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
interface where you can physically see
 

331
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,990
interface where you can physically see
that your agent or agents have their own

332
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
that your agent or agents have their own
 

333
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,150
that your agent or agents have their own
workspace, their own desktop where it

334
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
workspace, their own desktop where it
 

335
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,870
workspace, their own desktop where it
can build, manage files, operate its own

336
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
can build, manage files, operate its own
 

337
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,110
can build, manage files, operate its own
environment fully, but you want to

338
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
environment fully, but you want to
 

339
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,270
environment fully, but you want to
separate it from your Mac in your life

340
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
separate it from your Mac in your life
 

341
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,310
separate it from your Mac in your life
so you don't risk hackers, viruses, all

342
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
so you don't risk hackers, viruses, all
 

343
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,830
so you don't risk hackers, viruses, all
kinds of things going wrong. That's

344
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
kinds of things going wrong. That's
 

345
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,830
kinds of things going wrong. That's
where the Mac Mini is becoming helpful.

346
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
where the Mac Mini is becoming helpful.
 

347
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,070
where the Mac Mini is becoming helpful.
And also if you want to use open source

359
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,950

language models a lot more easily. But

360
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
language models a lot more easily. But
 

361
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,749
language models a lot more easily. But
for most of your audience the cloud is

for most of your audience the cloud is
 

363
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,430
for most of your audience the cloud is
probably one of the best places to go.

00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm also going to be including a more
 

435
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,070
I'm also going to be including a more
in-depth breakdown of each of the

436
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
in-depth breakdown of each of the
 

437
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,589

that you can take action on them today.
 

441
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,950
that you can take action on them today.
Yeah. And there's one more thing. Um,

442
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
Yeah. And there's one more thing. Um,
 

443
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,230
Yeah. And there's one more thing. Um,
let's say you don't want the Mac Mini,

444
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
let's say you don't want the Mac Mini,
 

445
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,589
let's say you don't want the Mac Mini,
but you still want to run it locally.

446
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
but you still want to run it locally.
 

447
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,510
but you still want to run it locally.
You could also use something like Docker

448
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
You could also use something like Docker
 

449
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,510
You could also use something like Docker
to create a container to run a local

450
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
to create a container to run a local
 

451
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,350
to create a container to run a local
model to also interface with this. So,

452
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
model to also interface with this. So,
 

453
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,110
model to also interface with this. So,
it's very malleable because it's open

454
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
it's very malleable because it's open
 

455
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,110
it's very malleable because it's open
source and unlike a company telling you

456
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
source and unlike a company telling you
 

457
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,430
source and unlike a company telling you
how you have to use something, it's

458
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
how you have to use something, it's
 

459
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,870
how you have to use something, it's
completely up to you. It's just a matter

460
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
completely up to you. It's just a matter
 

461
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,629
completely up to you. It's just a matter
of what fits the best for you. Now, in

462
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
of what fits the best for you. Now, in
 

463
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,110
of what fits the best for you. Now, in
terms of where mine lives. So, obviously

464
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
terms of where mine lives. So, obviously
 

465
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,510
terms of where mine lives. So, obviously
I have the Mac Mini here. Where it lives

466
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
I have the Mac Mini here. Where it lives
 

467
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,589
I have the Mac Mini here. Where it lives
is its own laptop. So, this laptop, I'm

468
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
is its own laptop. So, this laptop, I'm
 

469
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,589
is its own laptop. So, this laptop, I'm
basically rendering this on my actual

470
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
basically rendering this on my actual
 

471
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,830
basically rendering this on my actual
screen on my real laptop. It just has

472
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
screen on my real laptop. It just has
 

473
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,070
screen on my real laptop. It just has
access to its own notes. It creates its

474
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
access to its own notes. It creates its
 

475
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,469
access to its own notes. It creates its
own folders. It manages this system. So

476
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
own folders. It manages this system. So
 

477
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,870
own folders. It manages this system. So
this is technically my agent's computer,

478
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
this is technically my agent's computer,
 

479
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,029
this is technically my agent's computer,
which is why it's so malleable, because

480
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
which is why it's so malleable, because
 

481
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,189
which is why it's so malleable, because
anything that happens here is only

482
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
anything that happens here is only
 

483
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,550
anything that happens here is only
constrained to what's happened here. So

484
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
constrained to what's happened here. So
 

485
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,390
constrained to what's happened here. So
in other words, the blast radius of

486
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
in other words, the blast radius of
 

487
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,790
in other words, the blast radius of
anything going haywire won't affect my

488
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
anything going haywire won't affect my
 

489
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,670
anything going haywire won't affect my
finances, my credit cards, or my files

490
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
finances, my credit cards, or my files
 

491
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,150
finances, my credit cards, or my files
in general, which is a piece of mind if

492
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
in general, which is a piece of mind if
 

493
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,309
in general, which is a piece of mind if
it's something within reach because you

494
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
it's something within reach because you
 

495
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,990
it's something within reach because you
can manage everything and you can also

496
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
can manage everything and you can also
 

497
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,990
can manage everything and you can also
manage what's being installed, how it's

498
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
manage what's being installed, how it's
 

499
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,790
manage what's being installed, how it's
being used.

500
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
being used.
 

501
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,150
being used.

myself now just so I can tinker around

504
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
myself now just so I can tinker around
 

505
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,430
myself now just so I can tinker around
over it over over the next week or so.

506
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
over it over over the next week or so.
 

507
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,430
over it over over the next week or so.
And uh once you set it up, it comes with

508
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
And uh once you set it up, it comes with
 

509
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,990
And uh once you set it up, it comes with
its own localhosted command center. So

510
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
its own localhosted command center. So
 

511
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,390
its own localhosted command center. So
this is the Cloudbot command center.

512
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
this is the Cloudbot command center.
 

513
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,230
this is the Cloudbot command center.
This gives you an overview over how long

514
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
This gives you an overview over how long
 

515
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,070
This gives you an overview over how long
it's been connected, how many instances

516
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
it's been connected, how many instances
 

517
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,029
it's been connected, how many instances
it has. Uh if it has jobs that it runs

518
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
it has. Uh if it has jobs that it runs
 

519
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,029
it has. Uh if it has jobs that it runs

what's called a cron, when you speak to

522
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
what's called a cron, when you speak to
 

523
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,430
what's called a cron, when you speak to
it, let's say via Telegram like I do, it

524
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
it, let's say via Telegram like I do, it
 

525
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,189
it, let's say via Telegram like I do, it
can decide, okay, cool. It looks like

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,990
Mark wants to run this reminder to go
check his YouTube competitors and look

530
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
check his YouTube competitors and look
 

531
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,029
check his YouTube competitors and look
at their comments using the app scraper

532
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
at their comments using the app scraper
 

533
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,509
at their comments using the app scraper
every hour or every 3 hours. And this is

534
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
every hour or every 3 hours. And this is
 

535
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,269
every hour or every 3 hours. And this is
where the proactivity comes in because

536
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
where the proactivity comes in because
 

537
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,750
where the proactivity comes in because
it basically pings its own server and it

538
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
it basically pings its own server and it
 

539
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,389
it basically pings its own server and it
messages me whatever I'm looking for.

540
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
messages me whatever I'm looking for.
 

541
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,150
messages me whatever I'm looking for.
And then a part of that picture is

542
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
And then a part of that picture is
 

543
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,070
And then a part of that picture is
obviously skills. So like you have

544
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
obviously skills. So like you have
 

545
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,710
obviously skills. So like you have
normal cloud skills, these are all open-

546
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
normal cloud skills, these are all open-
 

547
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,470
normal cloud skills, these are all open-
source skills. So these skills let it

548
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
source skills. So these skills let it
 

549
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,630
source skills. So these skills let it
use things like the Apple reminders,

550
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
use things like the Apple reminders,
 

551
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,070
use things like the Apple reminders,
write its own notes, watch for blogs,

552
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
write its own notes, watch for blogs,
 

553
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,150
write its own notes, watch for blogs,
take a screenshot of its own

554
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
take a screenshot of its own
 

555
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,670
take a screenshot of its own
environment. So it can be literally be

556
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
environment. So it can be literally be
 

557
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,430
environment. So it can be literally be
like, am I doing the right thing? As if

558
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
like, am I doing the right thing? As if
 

559
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,190
like, am I doing the right thing? As if
it's like your actual virtual assistant.

560
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
it's like your actual virtual assistant.
 

561
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,790
it's like your actual virtual assistant.
>> Yep. So these are a lot of these come

562
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
>> Yep. So these are a lot of these come
 

563
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,230
>> Yep. So these are a lot of these come
out of the box in the in the setup

564
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
out of the box in the in the setup
 

565
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,790
out of the box in the in the setup
wizard, which is helpful, right? So this

566
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
wizard, which is helpful, right? So this
 

567
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,630
wizard, which is helpful, right? So this
is I think a huge leap forward. this is

568
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
is I think a huge leap forward. this is
 

569
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,230
is I think a huge leap forward. this is
is that these come out of the box and a

570
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
is that these come out of the box and a
 

571
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,070
is that these come out of the box and a
lot of the integrations like the 11 labs

572
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
lot of the integrations like the 11 labs
 

573
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,829
lot of the integrations like the 11 labs
one which we can showcase in a second

574
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
one which we can showcase in a second
 

575
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,550
one which we can showcase in a second
but instead of the like clunkiness of

576
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
but instead of the like clunkiness of
 

577
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,710
but instead of the like clunkiness of
MCPs and now bloated those can be these

578
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
MCPs and now bloated those can be these
 

579
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,230
MCPs and now bloated those can be these
skills now seem to be forming as like

580
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
skills now seem to be forming as like
 

581
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,790
skills now seem to be forming as like
the new unit of like integration or as

582
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
the new unit of like integration or as
 

583
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,949
the new unit of like integration or as
as a feature and the fact that we'll be

584
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
as a feature and the fact that we'll be
 

585
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,470
as a feature and the fact that we'll be
able to like browse marketplaces for

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
able to like browse marketplaces for
 

587
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,590
able to like browse marketplaces for
these and figure out what we want to

588
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
these and figure out what we want to
 

589
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,150
these and figure out what we want to
plug in very quickly to our uh to our

plug in very quickly to our uh to our
personal like Jarvis here um I think is

592
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
personal like Jarvis here um I think is
 

593
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,470
personal like Jarvis here um I think is
is super exciting for for non techies

594
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
is super exciting for for non techies
 

595
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,030
is super exciting for for non techies
especially

596
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
especially

difference between skills and MCP. A

600
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
difference between skills and MCP. A
 

601
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,630
difference between skills and MCP. A
skill is like a constrained set of let's

602
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
skill is like a constrained set of let's
 

603
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,150
skill is like a constrained set of let's
say endpoints or different

604
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
say endpoints or different
 

605
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,829
say endpoints or different
functionalities from a service. Let's

606
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
functionalities from a service. Let's
 

607
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,230
functionalities from a service. Let's
use 11 Labs as an example. If you want

608
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
use 11 Labs as an example. If you want
 

609
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,230
use 11 Labs as an example. If you want
to clone a voice, if you want to

610
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
to clone a voice, if you want to
 

611
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,670
to clone a voice, if you want to
generate something with an existing

612
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
generate something with an existing
 

613
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,030
generate something with an existing
voice, those are two different

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,949
voice, those are two different
functions. So, skill just creates a

00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
functions. So, skill just creates a
 

617
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,190
functions. So, skill just creates a
cheat sheet in plain English with those

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
cheat sheet in plain English with those
 

619

624
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
when to use it. And the core difference
 

625
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,150
when to use it. And the core difference
is an MCP is kind of always on, meaning

is an MCP is kind of always on, meaning
 

627
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,910
is an MCP is kind of always on, meaning
it's bloating your context window of

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,030
agent to time out. A skill is invoked
just in time, meaning whenever it's

Yeah. And then when it comes to um where
 

681

Yeah. And then when it comes to um where
you can interface with it, you can also

711
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,030
you're still okay, let's say you know
cloud code. So if I say the words claude

712
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
cloud code. So if I say the words claude
 

713
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,430
cloud code. So if I say the words claude
code then when I say claude MD might

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
a bit different. When you onboard
 

731
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,069
a bit different. When you onboard
Cloudbot it asks you questions about how

732
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
Cloudbot it asks you questions about how
 

733
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,310
Cloudbot it asks you questions about how
it should behave. So it's fully going

734
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
it should behave. So it's fully going
 

735
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,990
it should behave. So it's fully going
the personal assistant angle. Literally

736
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
the personal assistant angle. Literally
 

737
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,069
the personal assistant angle. Literally
ask me when you're wrong Mark. Do you

738
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
ask me when you're wrong Mark. Do you
 

739
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,509
ask me when you're wrong Mark. Do you
want me to be direct and tell you wrong

740
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
want me to be direct and tell you wrong
 

741
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,430
want me to be direct and tell you wrong
or do you want me to be soft or passive

742
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
or do you want me to be soft or passive
 

743
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,509
or do you want me to be soft or passive
about it? So, it interviews you in

744
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
about it? So, it interviews you in
 

745
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,310
about it? So, it interviews you in
natural language and then it stores your

746
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
natural language and then it stores your
 

747
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,949
natural language and then it stores your
preferences in its soul.mmarkdown

748
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
preferences in its soul.mmarkdown
 

749
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,990
preferences in its soul.mmarkdown
file. So, it's literally called

751
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,550
file. So, it's literally called
soul.mmarkdown. Then asks you what it

752
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
soul.mmarkdown. Then asks you what it
 

753
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,110
soul.mmarkdown. Then asks you what it
should identify as by name, creature,

754
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
should identify as by name, creature,
 

755
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,389
should identify as by name, creature,
etc. So, it out of the box in 15 minutes

756
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
etc. So, it out of the box in 15 minutes
 

757
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,230

once you have it installed, it's ready
 

759
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,829
once you have it installed, it's ready
to go. It knows how to speak to you. I

to go. It knows how to speak to you. I
 

761
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,430
to go. It knows how to speak to you. I
told it I like lowercase. I write in

762
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
told it I like lowercase. I write in
 

763
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,269
told it I like lowercase. I write in
lowercase. Don't give me some cookie

764
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
lowercase. Don't give me some cookie
 

765
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,870
lowercase. Don't give me some cookie
cutter stuff. Don't say I'm absolutely

767
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,470
cutter stuff. Don't say I'm absolutely
right. and then we were ready to go.

768
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
right. and then we were ready to go.

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,470
right. and then we were ready to go.
>> Now, we might have this just after this,

770
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
>> Now, we might have this just after this,
 

771
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,550
>> Now, we might have this just after this,
but when it comes to building in your

workflows to this, so you've got your
 

775
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,670
workflows to this, so you've got your
workspace set up, you might provide it

776
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
workspace set up, you might provide it
 

777
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,990

then are you needing to create custom
 

785
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,790
then are you needing to create custom
skills or are there like simple commands

skills or are there like simple commands
 

787
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,069
skills or are there like simple commands
that you can set up? How do you then

788
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
that you can set up? How do you then
 

789
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,470
that you can set up? How do you then
start to make workflows on top of this?

790
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
start to make workflows on top of this?
 

791
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,269
start to make workflows on top of this?
So, one tool that I like to use quite a

792
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
So, one tool that I like to use quite a
 

793
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,710
So, one tool that I like to use quite a
bit, you can use whatever you want. Any

794
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
bit, you can use whatever you want. Any
 

795
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,509
bit, you can use whatever you want. Any
form of IDE where it can do stuff is

796
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
form of IDE where it can do stuff is
 

797
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,670
form of IDE where it can do stuff is
helpful. I like to use warp because it

798
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
helpful. I like to use warp because it
 

799
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,310
helpful. I like to use warp because it
has a free tier. So, what I like to do

800
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
has a free tier. So, what I like to do
 

801
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,150
has a free tier. So, what I like to do
is I just go and I say, "Hey, can you go

802
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
is I just go and I say, "Hey, can you go
 

803
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,990
is I just go and I say, "Hey, can you go
interface with Claudebot? I don't feel

804
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
interface with Claudebot? I don't feel
 

805
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,629
interface with Claudebot? I don't feel
like building a skill, but can you go

806
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
like building a skill, but can you go
 

807
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,750
like building a skill, but can you go
and figure out how to use insert X API?"

808
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
and figure out how to use insert X API?"
 

809
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,389
and figure out how to use insert X API?"
Let's say we want to do the Hen API to

810
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
Let's say we want to do the Hen API to
 

811
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,230
Let's say we want to do the Hen API to
make a copy of ourselves. Go look at the

812
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
make a copy of ourselves. Go look at the
 

813
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,949
make a copy of ourselves. Go look at the
Hen API. see what you need from me and

814
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
Hen API. see what you need from me and
 

815
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,710
Hen API. see what you need from me and
see what would it take to make a skill.

816
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
see what would it take to make a skill.
 

817
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,629
see what would it take to make a skill.
Then once it creates a skill, it stores

818
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
Then once it creates a skill, it stores
 

819
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,470
Then once it creates a skill, it stores
it behind the scenes and it tells

820
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
it behind the scenes and it tells
 

821
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,790
it behind the scenes and it tells
Claudebot in its like identity and its

822
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
Claudebot in its like identity and its
 

823
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,870
Claudebot in its like identity and its
tools file, make sure that when Mark

824
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
tools file, make sure that when Mark
 

825
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,230
tools file, make sure that when Mark
says clone or avatar, we use this heygen

826
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
says clone or avatar, we use this heygen
 

827
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,470
says clone or avatar, we use this heygen
skill. So that's one avenue. Another

828
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
skill. So that's one avenue. Another
 

829
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,310
skill. So that's one avenue. Another
avenue is once you have it set it up

830
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
avenue is once you have it set it up
 

831
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,110
avenue is once you have it set it up
well, you can actually ask Claudebot to

832
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
well, you can actually ask Claudebot to
 

833
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,509
well, you can actually ask Claudebot to
create the skill itself. So once in a

834
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
create the skill itself. So once in a
 

835
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,030
create the skill itself. So once in a
while I'll ask it, I have a challenge

836
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
while I'll ask it, I have a challenge
 

837
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,550
while I'll ask it, I have a challenge
for you. I don't know how you're going

838
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
for you. I don't know how you're going
 

839
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,110
for you. I don't know how you're going
to do this, but I have this voice note

840
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
to do this, but I have this voice note
 

841
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,350
to do this, but I have this voice note
from Liam. I want you to take this voice

842
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
from Liam. I want you to take this voice
 

843
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,509
from Liam. I want you to take this voice
note and I want you to clone his voice

844
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
note and I want you to clone his voice
 

845
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,190
note and I want you to clone his voice
somehow using 11 laps. I'm not gonna

846
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,200
somehow using 11 laps. I'm not gonna
 

847
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,629
somehow using 11 laps. I'm not gonna
tell you how. I'm not going to tell you

848
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
tell you how. I'm not going to tell you
 

849
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,790
tell you how. I'm not going to tell you
where. You have the API key. Go figure

850
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
where. You have the API key. Go figure
 

851
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,670
where. You have the API key. Go figure
it out. So, it will go 5 10 minutes, try

852
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
it out. So, it will go 5 10 minutes, try
 

853
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,350
it out. So, it will go 5 10 minutes, try
a couple things, then come back and

854
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
a couple things, then come back and
 

855
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,949
a couple things, then come back and
figure it out. Okay. So, if we pop in,

856
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
figure it out. Okay. So, if we pop in,
 

857
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,629
figure it out. Okay. So, if we pop in,
you can see this is my beautiful

858
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
you can see this is my beautiful
 

859
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,310
you can see this is my beautiful
assistant Claudet. I actually asked her

to make her own profile picture and I
 

863
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,790
to make her own profile picture and I
asked her, can you tell me what Liam's

864
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
asked her, can you tell me what Liam's
 

865
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,389

last three videos were about? So behind

866
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
last three videos were about? So behind
 

867
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,790
last three videos were about? So behind
the scenes I gave it access to ampify

868
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
the scenes I gave it access to ampify
 

869
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,629
the scenes I gave it access to ampify
specifically the MCP just to make it

870
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
specifically the MCP just to make it
 

871
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,430
specifically the MCP just to make it
easier. It went kind of scraped it turns

872
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
easier. It went kind of scraped it turns
 

873
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,990
easier. It went kind of scraped it turns

integrated because of it like depth of

880
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
integrated because of it like depth of
 

881
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,069
integrated because of it like depth of
different scrapers. Right? So that's

882
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
different scrapers. Right? So that's
 

883
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,230
different scrapers. Right? So that's
just like a very easy general purpose uh

884
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
just like a very easy general purpose uh
 

885

just like a very easy general purpose uh
connection you can make to give your

886
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
connection you can make to give your
 

887
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,310
connection you can make to give your
your clawbot a ton more capability.

your clawbot a ton more capability.
 

889
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,670
your clawbot a ton more capability.
Right. So it can find a LinkedIn scraper

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
can you go learn how to use the appy mcp
 

921
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,069
can you go learn how to use the appy mcp
and then you can add whatever actors you

922
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
and then you can add whatever actors you
 

923
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,110
and then you can add whatever actors you
want. So, in this case, you can just

924
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
want. So, in this case, you can just
 

925
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,990
want. So, in this case, you can just
literally go select them, click save,

926
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
literally go select them, click save,
 

927
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,829
literally go select them, click save,
then you're good to go. And then

928
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
then you're good to go. And then
 

929
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,750
then you're good to go. And then
>> so you manually add those in or there is

930
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
>> so you manually add those in or there is
 

931
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,910
>> so you manually add those in or there is
a like when it uses the search function

932
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
a like when it uses the search function
 

933
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,949
a like when it uses the search function
there. Is it going to search from the

934
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
there. Is it going to search from the
 

935
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,230
there. Is it going to search from the
ones you've enabled or is it going to

936
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
ones you've enabled or is it going to
 

937
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,949
ones you've enabled or is it going to
search the whole uh the whole database

938
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
search the whole uh the whole database
 

939
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,910
search the whole uh the whole database
of of actors?

940
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
of of actors?
 

941
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,110
of of actors?
>> You're asking the right questions. So

942
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
>> You're asking the right questions. So
 

943
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,030
>> You're asking the right questions. So
out of the box I manually put ones in

944
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
out of the box I manually put ones in
 

945
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,350
out of the box I manually put ones in
that I know for a fact I want always. So

946
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
that I know for a fact I want always. So
 

947
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,350
that I know for a fact I want always. So
that's where I added them here. And then

948
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
that's where I added them here. And then
 

949
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,269
that's where I added them here. And then
you just have to enable it to search

950
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
you just have to enable it to search
 

951
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,829
you just have to enable it to search
actors and call actors. And then if it's

952
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
actors and call actors. And then if it's
 

953
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,350
actors and call actors. And then if it's
not there, if it doesn't have, let's

954
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
not there, if it doesn't have, let's
 

955
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,670
not there, if it doesn't have, let's
say, a LinkedIn scraper, it can go and

956
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
say, a LinkedIn scraper, it can go and
 

957
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,750
say, a LinkedIn scraper, it can go and
search for an actor that's highly rated

958
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:39,760
search for an actor that's highly rated
 

959
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,269
search for an actor that's highly rated
and then add that to its stack.

960
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
and then add that to its stack.
 

961
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,230
and then add that to its stack.
>> That's super helpful.

962
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
>> That's super helpful.
 

963
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,150
>> That's super helpful.
>> That's how we got these YouTube videos.

964
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
>> That's how we got these YouTube videos.
 

965
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,590
>> That's how we got these YouTube videos.
And then this is the part where it's

966
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
And then this is the part where it's
 

967
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,389
And then this is the part where it's
super cool. I sent it a voice note um

968
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
super cool. I sent it a voice note um
 

969
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,670
super cool. I sent it a voice note um
just to better understand what's

970
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
just to better understand what's
 

971
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,269
just to better understand what's
happening. And like I asked it, can you

972
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
happening. And like I asked it, can you
 

973
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,670
happening. And like I asked it, can you
create a clone of the following voice

974
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
create a clone of the following voice
 

975
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,269
create a clone of the following voice
note that I'm about to send you? So it I

976
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
note that I'm about to send you? So it I
 

977
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,949
note that I'm about to send you? So it I
basically gave it this voice note of

978
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
basically gave it this voice note of
 

979
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,030
basically gave it this voice note of
Liam swearing at me for being late to

980
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
Liam swearing at me for being late to
 

981
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,509
Liam swearing at me for being late to
this pod. and then listened to it. And

982
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
this pod. and then listened to it. And
 

983
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,829
this pod. and then listened to it. And
then I said, "Can you use this file to

984
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
then I said, "Can you use this file to
 

985
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,470
then I said, "Can you use this file to
clone his voice and send me a sample of

986
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
clone his voice and send me a sample of
 

987
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,790
clone his voice and send me a sample of
the clone telling me that he loves me?"

988
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
the clone telling me that he loves me?"
 

989
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,590
the clone telling me that he loves me?"
Now, I would love to play this, but Liam

990
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
Now, I would love to play this, but Liam
 

991
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,189
Now, I would love to play this, but Liam
kind of muffled his own voice on

992
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
kind of muffled his own voice on
 

993
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,470
kind of muffled his own voice on
purpose, so it was going to sound super

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
purpose, so it was going to sound super
 

995
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,509
purpose, so it was going to sound super
goofy. Do you want me to play it or

1029
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,350
>> that started glazing me immediately.
>> Yeah. I mean, that's part two. That's

1030
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
>> Yeah. I mean, that's part two. That's
 

1031

>> Yeah. I mean, that's part two. That's
part two. But part one is it ran this

part two. But part one is it ran this
 

1033
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,189
part two. But part one is it ran this
job that I told it to do to look for my

job that I told it to do to look for my
YouTube competitor. So then it found the

1036
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
YouTube competitor. So then it found the
 

1037
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,030

that had a video around Claude. So I was
 

1041
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,550
that had a video around Claude. So I was
just like in the middle of it. But

1042
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
just like in the middle of it. But
 

1043
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,230
just like in the middle of it. But
here's the part glazing you.

>> All right, let's break down Liam Ali's
 

1047
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,829
>> All right, let's break down Liam Ali's
channel strategy. So Liam is at 724K

1048
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
channel strategy. So Liam is at 724K
 

1049
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,350
channel strategy. So Liam is at 724K
subs right now. He's absolutely crushing

1050
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
subs right now. He's absolutely crushing
 

1051
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,189
subs right now. He's absolutely crushing
it in the AI automation space. And his

1052
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
it in the AI automation space. And his
 

1053
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,309
it in the AI automation space. And his
whole strategy is built around this

1054
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
whole strategy is built around this
 

1055
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,309
whole strategy is built around this
concept he created called the AAA model,

1056
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
concept he created called the AAA model,
 

1057

>> We got the idea. [laughter]
 

1061
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,029
>> We got the idea. [laughter]
So that's that you're asking it for a

So that's that you're asking it for a

So that's that you're asking it for a
Did did you ask it to give a audio

1064
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
Did did you ask it to give a audio

00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,630
So, different platforms for different
parts of your workflow, at least for

1226
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
parts of your workflow, at least for
 

1227
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,110
parts of your workflow, at least for
now.

1228
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,120

1240
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
daily life. So, um yeah, this is super
 

1241
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,710
daily life. So, um yeah, this is super
super interesting, man. of how this

1242
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
super interesting, man. of how this
 

1243
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,590
super interesting, man. of how this
rolls out, whether it's like eventually

1244
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
rolls out, whether it's like eventually
 

1245
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,510
rolls out, whether it's like eventually
it consolidates into just one thing that

1246
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520
it consolidates into just one thing that
 

1247
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,990
it consolidates into just one thing that
you're using um or you still have a

1248
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
you're using um or you still have a
 

1249

1250
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
couple dedicated workspaces you set up
 

1251
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,909
couple dedicated workspaces you set up
for certain things. Yeah, it's just it's

1252
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
for certain things. Yeah, it's just it's
 

1253
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,950
for certain things. Yeah, it's just it's
interesting because when I give it its

1254
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
interesting because when I give it its
 

1255
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,590
interesting because when I give it its
own laptop to work on and let's say it

1256
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
own laptop to work on and let's say it
 

1257
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,990
own laptop to work on and let's say it
does something wrong. So, one thing that

1258
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
does something wrong. So, one thing that
 

1259
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,270
does something wrong. So, one thing that
we're going to talk about shortly as

1260
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
we're going to talk about shortly as
 

1261
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,789
we're going to talk about shortly as
little Debbie Downers is what happens

1262
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
little Debbie Downers is what happens
 

1263
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,590
little Debbie Downers is what happens
when it comes to security. So, I saw a

1264
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
when it comes to security. So, I saw a
 

1265
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,190
when it comes to security. So, I saw a
bunch of tweets saying, you know, this

1266
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200
bunch of tweets saying, you know, this
 

1267
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,789
bunch of tweets saying, you know, this
is insecure, this is insecure, be

1268
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
is insecure, this is insecure, be
 

1269
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,870
is insecure, this is insecure, be
careful of this. I taught it to scrape

1270
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
careful of this. I taught it to scrape
 

1271
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,669
careful of this. I taught it to scrape
X. So then I started sending it all the

1272
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
X. So then I started sending it all the
 

1273
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,190
X. So then I started sending it all the
tweets saying, can you make sure we're

1274
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
tweets saying, can you make sure we're
 

1275
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,029
tweets saying, can you make sure we're
covered on these security things? And

1276
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
covered on these security things? And
 

1277
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,190
covered on these security things? And
then it made its own notes in its notes

1278
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
then it made its own notes in its notes
 

1279
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,549
then it made its own notes in its notes
folder on like the things that were

1280
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
folder on like the things that were
 

1281
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,470
folder on like the things that were
covered for what it needs to implement.

1282
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
covered for what it needs to implement.
 

1283
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,390
covered for what it needs to implement.
So it can even make its own to-do list.

1284
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
So it can even make its own to-do list.
 

1285
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,830
So it can even make its own to-do list.
You don't need an obsidian. You don't

1286
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
You don't need an obsidian. You don't
 

1287
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,630
You don't need an obsidian. You don't
need a notion. You could it has the same

1288
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
need a notion. You could it has the same
 

1289
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,190
need a notion. You could it has the same
access as an employee with a laptop. And

1290
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
access as an employee with a laptop. And
 

1291
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,669
access as an employee with a laptop. And
that's why all the use cases that need

1292
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
that's why all the use cases that need
 

1293
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,190
that's why all the use cases that need
to exist don't exist yet.

1294
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
to exist don't exist yet.
 

1295
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,510
to exist don't exist yet.
>> Man, it's exciting, man.

1296
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
>> Man, it's exciting, man.
 

1297
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,750
>> Man, it's exciting, man.
>> It's insane. But we do have to talk

1298
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
>> It's insane. But we do have to talk
 

1299
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,549
>> It's insane. But we do have to talk
about the elephant in the room, the crab

1300
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
about the elephant in the room, the crab
 

1301
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,029
about the elephant in the room, the crab
in the room, which is security. So if

1302
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
in the room, which is security. So if
 

1303
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,430
in the room, which is security. So if
you go on X, you'll find tons of people

1304
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
you go on X, you'll find tons of people
 

1305
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,990
you go on X, you'll find tons of people
warning, sounding the alarms that this

1306
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
warning, sounding the alarms that this
 

1307
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,310
warning, sounding the alarms that this
is actually a picture of people around

1308
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,320
is actually a picture of people around
 

1309
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,870
is actually a picture of people around
the world that have spun up Clawbot on a

1310
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880
the world that have spun up Clawbot on a
 

1311
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,750
the world that have spun up Clawbot on a
server. So this is the blast radius of

1312
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
server. So this is the blast radius of
 

1313
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,310
server. So this is the blast radius of
chaos. And if you don't know what you're

1314
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
chaos. And if you don't know what you're
 

1315
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,310
chaos. And if you don't know what you're
doing, yes, it can be cheaper than

1316
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
doing, yes, it can be cheaper than
 

1317
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,029
doing, yes, it can be cheaper than
buying a two grand Mac Mini, but if you

1318
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
buying a two grand Mac Mini, but if you
 

1319
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,190
buying a two grand Mac Mini, but if you
don't know what you're doing, there's so

1320
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,200
don't know what you're doing, there's so
 

1321
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,549
don't know what you're doing, there's so
many vectors that an IT person or a

1322
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
many vectors that an IT person or a
 

1323
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,669
many vectors that an IT person or a
hacker can use to get access to your

1324
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
hacker can use to get access to your
 

1325
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,230
hacker can use to get access to your
personal laptop, your WhatsApp, your

1326
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
personal laptop, your WhatsApp, your
 

1327
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,310
personal laptop, your WhatsApp, your
funds, your credit cards. So even though

1328
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
funds, your credit cards. So even though
 

1329
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,549
funds, your credit cards. So even though
this is super cool, well, I'm going to

1330
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
this is super cool, well, I'm going to
 

1331
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,710
this is super cool, well, I'm going to
like emphasize this, there are a lot of

1332
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
like emphasize this, there are a lot of
 

1333
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,630
like emphasize this, there are a lot of
consequences if you don't separate your

1334
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
consequences if you don't separate your
 

1335
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,789
consequences if you don't separate your
life. So even when when I created my

1336
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
life. So even when when I created my
 

1337
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,789
life. So even when when I created my
employee Clawudette, she has her own

1338
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
employee Clawudette, she has her own
 

1339
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,710
employee Clawudette, she has her own
iCloud account. She has her own brand

1340
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
iCloud account. She has her own brand
 

1341
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,789
iCloud account. She has her own brand
new email. Everything is completely

1342
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
new email. Everything is completely
 

1343
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,590
new email. Everything is completely
separate from me.

1344
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600

1345
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,990
separate from me.

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,789
your actual WhatsApp and you have a
bunch of what are called ports open for

1376
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
bunch of what are called ports open for
 

1377
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,470
bunch of what are called ports open for
different services. If you don't secure

1378
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
different services. If you don't secure
 

1379
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,310
different services. If you don't secure
those ports, people can take advantage

1380
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
those ports, people can take advantage
 

1381
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,070
those ports, people can take advantage
of those and once they're in one, they

1382
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
of those and once they're in one, they
 

1383
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,430
of those and once they're in one, they
can find their way to tunnel into the

1384
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
can find their way to tunnel into the
 

1385
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,190
can find their way to tunnel into the
rest of your services or files or

1386
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
rest of your services or files or
 

1387
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,390
rest of your services or files or
whatever. That's number two.

1388
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
whatever. That's number two.
 

1389
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,310

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,350
what you thought were private files,
right? like if you've got I don't know

1394
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
right? like if you've got I don't know
 

1395
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,789
right? like if you've got I don't know

1401
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,110

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
so do your own due diligence, but like
 

1413
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,510
so do your own due diligence, but like
even with the keys that you give it,

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
even with the keys that you give it,
 

1415
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,350
even with the keys that you give it,
let's say you give it the 11 Labs API

1416
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
let's say you give it the 11 Labs API
 

1417
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,270
let's say you give it the 11 Labs API
key. Let's say you give it the I don't

1418
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
key. Let's say you give it the I don't
 

1419
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,470
key. Let's say you give it the I don't
know, GitHub. A lot of people are using

1420
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
know, GitHub. A lot of people are using
 

1421
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,830
know, GitHub. A lot of people are using
it for GitHub where they're like, you

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
it for GitHub where they're like, you
 

1423
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,990
it for GitHub where they're like, you
know what, go look on my vibe coded app

1424
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000
know what, go look on my vibe coded app
 

1425
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,830
know what, go look on my vibe coded app
while I sleep. go come up with a series

1426
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
while I sleep. go come up with a series
 

1427
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,830
while I sleep. go come up with a series
of improvements and work on it until I

1428
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
of improvements and work on it until I
 

1429
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,390
of improvements and work on it until I
wake up. Theoretically, beautiful. But

1430
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
wake up. Theoretically, beautiful. But
 

1431
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,990
wake up. Theoretically, beautiful. But
behind the scenes, if you give it full

1432
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
behind the scenes, if you give it full
 

1433
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,909
behind the scenes, if you give it full
access to all of your GitHub and let's

1434
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
access to all of your GitHub and let's
 

1435
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,510
access to all of your GitHub and let's
say you're an agency and you have actual

1436
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
say you're an agency and you have actual
 

1437
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,510
say you're an agency and you have actual
client projects and someone gets a

1438
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
client projects and someone gets a
 

1439
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,270
client projects and someone gets a
handle for that GitHub and you've

1440
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
handle for that GitHub and you've
 

1441
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,510
handle for that GitHub and you've
enabled the key to access everything,

1442
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
enabled the key to access everything,
 

1443
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,990
enabled the key to access everything,
not just one repo, it could be a

1444
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
not just one repo, it could be a
 

1445
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,270
not just one repo, it could be a
disaster. So,

1446
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:41,280
disaster. So,
 

1447
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,669
disaster. So,
>> okay, just scoping scoping those keys is

1448
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
>> okay, just scoping scoping those keys is
 

1449
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,149
>> okay, just scoping scoping those keys is
important.

1450
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
important.
 

1451
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,549
important.
>> Yeah. So, just scoping that out. And I

1452
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
>> Yeah. So, just scoping that out. And I
 

1453
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,830
>> Yeah. So, just scoping that out. And I
have a little bit of a checklist here.

1454
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
have a little bit of a checklist here.
 

1455
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,390
have a little bit of a checklist here.
Again, not meant to glaze over your eyes

1456
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
Again, not meant to glaze over your eyes
 

1457
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,110
Again, not meant to glaze over your eyes
of the audience, but if you want to

1458
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
of the audience, but if you want to
 

1459
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,710
of the audience, but if you want to
deploy it locally, there's this mode

1460
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
deploy it locally, there's this mode
 

1461
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,789
deploy it locally, there's this mode
called sandbox mode. All I did is

1462
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
called sandbox mode. All I did is
 

1463
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,870
called sandbox mode. All I did is
literally asked Warp to talk to Cloudbot

1464
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:58,880
literally asked Warp to talk to Cloudbot
 

1465
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,870
literally asked Warp to talk to Cloudbot
and make sure we running in sandbox

1466
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
and make sure we running in sandbox
 

1467
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,630
and make sure we running in sandbox
mode. Um, if you want to self-host,

1468
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,640
mode. Um, if you want to self-host,
 

1469
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,230
mode. Um, if you want to self-host,
obviously local models is the safest

1470
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
obviously local models is the safest
 

1471
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,310
obviously local models is the safest
way. If you have credentials and

1472
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
way. If you have credentials and
 

1473
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,390
way. If you have credentials and
secrets, make sure that you put them

1474
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
secrets, make sure that you put them
 

1475
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,310
secrets, make sure that you put them
into secrets managers. You don't share

1476
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
into secrets managers. You don't share
 

1477
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,310
into secrets managers. You don't share
sensitive files. You you don't just put

1478
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
sensitive files. You you don't just put
 

1479
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,390
sensitive files. You you don't just put
a series of API keys in like an open

1480
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
a series of API keys in like an open
 

1481
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,190
a series of API keys in like an open
JSON that anyone can access. And then

1482
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
JSON that anyone can access. And then
 

1483
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,470
JSON that anyone can access. And then
you have all kinds of things around

1484
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
you have all kinds of things around
 

1485
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,549
you have all kinds of things around
monitoring, making sure that maybe you

1486
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
monitoring, making sure that maybe you
 

1487
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,630
monitoring, making sure that maybe you
have a cap on your API keys, so you

1488
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:22,640
have a cap on your API keys, so you
 

1489
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,470
have a cap on your API keys, so you
don't have a thousand dollars on

1490
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
don't have a thousand dollars on
 

1491
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,630
don't have a thousand dollars on
anthropic API ready to go. Maybe you got

1492
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
anthropic API ready to go. Maybe you got
 

1493
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,350
anthropic API ready to go. Maybe you got
like 20 bucks and it reloads for five

1494
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
like 20 bucks and it reloads for five
 

1495
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,430
like 20 bucks and it reloads for five
bucks every single time. So there's

1496
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
bucks every single time. So there's
 

1497
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,230
bucks every single time. So there's
layers of fail safes. So this is all we

1498
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,240
layers of fail safes. So this is all we
 

1499
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,149
layers of fail safes. So this is all we
know now, but there's going to be a lot

1500
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
know now, but there's going to be a lot
 

1501
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,110
know now, but there's going to be a lot
more because I'm pretty sure someone's

1502
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
more because I'm pretty sure someone's
 

1503
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,789
more because I'm pretty sure someone's
going to take advantage of this.

1504
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
going to take advantage of this.
 

1505
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,070
going to take advantage of this.
>> Yeah. So Mark and I had a bit of a

1506
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
>> Yeah. So Mark and I had a bit of a
 

1507
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,990
>> Yeah. So Mark and I had a bit of a
brainstorm on ways to make money with

1508
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
brainstorm on ways to make money with
 

1509
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,390
brainstorm on ways to make money with
this. And these are obviously very early

1510
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400
this. And these are obviously very early
 

1511
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,230
this. And these are obviously very early
stage. A lot of it is kind of arbitrage,

1512
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
stage. A lot of it is kind of arbitrage,
 

1513
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,149
stage. A lot of it is kind of arbitrage,
but it does go back to the kind of core

1514
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
but it does go back to the kind of core
 

1515
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,070
but it does go back to the kind of core
core principles of of the AI agency and

1516
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
core principles of of the AI agency and
 

1517
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,630
core principles of of the AI agency and
and AI services. So, uh, the obvious one

1518
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
and AI services. So, uh, the obvious one
 

1519
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,669
and AI services. So, uh, the obvious one
here is that with great power comes

1520
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:57,679
here is that with great power comes
 

1521
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,310
here is that with great power comes
great opportunity. Oh, I literally made

1522
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,320
great opportunity. Oh, I literally made
 

1523
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,750
great opportunity. Oh, I literally made
that up on the spot, but that makes a

1524
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
that up on the spot, but that makes a
 

1525
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,110
that up on the spot, but that makes a
lot of sense. When there's new powers

1526
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
lot of sense. When there's new powers
 

1527
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,070
lot of sense. When there's new powers
and there's new new there's Jarvis in a

1528
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
and there's new new there's Jarvis in a
 

1529
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,029
and there's new new there's Jarvis in a
on a on a local machine, uh, businesses

1530
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
on a on a local machine, uh, businesses
 

1531
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,549
on a on a local machine, uh, businesses
are going to be or some businesses, if

1532
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
are going to be or some businesses, if
 

1533
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,669
are going to be or some businesses, if
you can position it correctly, are going

1534
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:11,679
you can position it correctly, are going
 

1535
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,590
you can position it correctly, are going
to be interested in paying for this. So

1536
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
to be interested in paying for this. So
 

1537
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,990
to be interested in paying for this. So
that would involve you starting off just

1538
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
that would involve you starting off just
 

1539
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,470
that would involve you starting off just
uh setting it up for yourself. Do the uh

1540
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
uh setting it up for yourself. Do the uh
 

1541
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,230
uh setting it up for yourself. Do the uh
do the cloud host version first. Get a

1542
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
do the cloud host version first. Get a
 

1543
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,830
do the cloud host version first. Get a
feel for it. Once you're sure you've

1544
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
feel for it. Once you're sure you've
 

1545
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,190
feel for it. Once you're sure you've
kind of figured out the best workflows

1546
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,200
kind of figured out the best workflows
 

1547
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,110
kind of figured out the best workflows
for it, how to set them up quickly, you

1548
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
for it, how to set them up quickly, you
 

1549
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,470
for it, how to set them up quickly, you
could look to do it yourself. Purchase

1550
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
could look to do it yourself. Purchase
 

1551
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,190
could look to do it yourself. Purchase
one locally and then use that as a as a

1552
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
one locally and then use that as a as a
 

1553
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,269
one locally and then use that as a as a
template uh to offer that to businesses

1554
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
template uh to offer that to businesses
 

1555
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,190
template uh to offer that to businesses
as well. Um small businesses in your

1556
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
as well. Um small businesses in your
 

1557
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,430
as well. Um small businesses in your
area saying, "Hey, I can set this up for

1558
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
area saying, "Hey, I can set this up for
 

1559
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,870
area saying, "Hey, I can set this up for
you." The big issue here is the

1560
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
you." The big issue here is the
 

1561
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,310
you." The big issue here is the
education gap on what the hell this is.

1562
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
education gap on what the hell this is.
 

1563
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,310
education gap on what the hell this is.
cuz you guys are probably already an AI

1564
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
cuz you guys are probably already an AI
 

1565
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,830
cuz you guys are probably already an AI
enthusiast and you're watching this to

1566
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:41,840
enthusiast and you're watching this to
 

1567
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,750
enthusiast and you're watching this to
try to just like understand this uh as

1568
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
try to just like understand this uh as
 

1569
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,510
try to just like understand this uh as
the rest of us are. So there's going to

1570
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:45,520
the rest of us are. So there's going to
 

1571
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,510
the rest of us are. So there's going to
be a huge gap between where you are and

1572
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
be a huge gap between where you are and
 

1573
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,350
be a huge gap between where you are and
communicating this value. It's likely

1574
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
communicating this value. It's likely
 

1575
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,950
communicating this value. It's likely
going to be one of those cases of where

1576
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
going to be one of those cases of where
 

1577
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,029
going to be one of those cases of where
don't really tell them what like tell

1578
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
don't really tell them what like tell
 

1579
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,070
don't really tell them what like tell
them what what they're going to get out

1580
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
them what what they're going to get out
 

1581
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,990
them what what they're going to get out
of it. Don't try to explain all the AI

1582
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,000
of it. Don't try to explain all the AI
 

1583
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,990
of it. Don't try to explain all the AI
stuff under the hood. Just like I can do

1584
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,000
stuff under the hood. Just like I can do
 

1585
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,230
stuff under the hood. Just like I can do
X for you. Um here's how much it costs.

1586
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
X for you. Um here's how much it costs.
 

1587
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,390
X for you. Um here's how much it costs.
Like do you want this result? um

1588
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
Like do you want this result? um
 

1589
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,549
Like do you want this result? um
probably a personal assistant set up for

1590
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
probably a personal assistant set up for
 

1591
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,430
probably a personal assistant set up for
a founder or a CEO or a seuite person um

1592
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
a founder or a CEO or a seuite person um
 

1593
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,750
a founder or a CEO or a seuite person um
is uh the way to go here. Someone who's

1594
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,760
is uh the way to go here. Someone who's
 

1595
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,149
is uh the way to go here. Someone who's
got uh a lot of the the time is very

1596
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
got uh a lot of the the time is very
 

1597
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,990
got uh a lot of the the time is very
valuable. And like Mark said, having a

1598
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000
valuable. And like Mark said, having a
 

1599
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,230
valuable. And like Mark said, having a
personal assistant that can sort of have

1600
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,240
personal assistant that can sort of have
 

1601
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,750
personal assistant that can sort of have
the ability to access the right things

1602
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
the ability to access the right things
 

1603
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,149
the ability to access the right things
and and do little uh little admin tasks

1604
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
and and do little uh little admin tasks
 

1605
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,390
and and do little uh little admin tasks
for them and offering that as a service

1606
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:22,400
for them and offering that as a service
 

1607
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,470
for them and offering that as a service
to sell those to businesses or even to

1608
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
to sell those to businesses or even to
 

1609
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,470
to sell those to businesses or even to
individuals maybe to like targeting

1610
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
individuals maybe to like targeting
 

1611
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,990
individuals maybe to like targeting
entrepreneurs who are busy and want to

1612
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
entrepreneurs who are busy and want to
 

1613
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,750
entrepreneurs who are busy and want to
have more time. Uh so setting these up

1614
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
have more time. Uh so setting these up
 

1615
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,430
have more time. Uh so setting these up
for them would be a great service. I

1616
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
for them would be a great service. I
 

1617
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,990
for them would be a great service. I
would also add in set up as a service,

1618
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,000
would also add in set up as a service,
 

1619
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,630
would also add in set up as a service,
set up as a education product as well.

1620
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
set up as a education product as well.
 

1621
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,190
set up as a education product as well.
Like you could drop a $97 course right

1622
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
Like you could drop a $97 course right
 

1623
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,630
Like you could drop a $97 course right
now on how to get the most out of it and

1624
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
now on how to get the most out of it and
 

1625
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,789
now on how to get the most out of it and
set it up. And as long as you have the

1626
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
set it up. And as long as you have the
 

1627
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,630
set it up. And as long as you have the
the the means to market it, then that's

1628
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
the the means to market it, then that's
 

1629
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,070
the the means to market it, then that's
an opportunity as well. So either the

1630
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
an opportunity as well. So either the
 

1631
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,470
an opportunity as well. So either the
service based approach and then the uh

1632
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
service based approach and then the uh
 

1633
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,630
service based approach and then the uh
the info approach. Uh the service one's

1634
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
the info approach. Uh the service one's
 

1635
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,830
the info approach. Uh the service one's
probably going to be again it's always

1636
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,840
probably going to be again it's always
 

1637
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,190
probably going to be again it's always
like how effectively can you market? If

1638
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,200
like how effectively can you market? If
 

1639
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,390
like how effectively can you market? If
you have an audience already, then it's

1640
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
you have an audience already, then it's
 

1641
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,149
you have an audience already, then it's
probably easier to sell the sell the

1642
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
probably easier to sell the sell the
 

1643
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,070
probably easier to sell the sell the
information. If you are starting off,

1644
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
information. If you are starting off,
 

1645
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,630
information. If you are starting off,
it's easy to do reachouts to find one or

1646
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
it's easy to do reachouts to find one or
 

1647
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,830
it's easy to do reachouts to find one or
two people who will pay you a few grand

1648
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
two people who will pay you a few grand
 

1649
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,510
two people who will pay you a few grand
for this uh rather than trying to get

1650
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
for this uh rather than trying to get
 

1651
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,190
for this uh rather than trying to get
thousands of people to buy your $97

1652
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
thousands of people to buy your $97
 

1653
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,190
thousands of people to buy your $97
course. All right, so the VA agency, not

1654
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
course. All right, so the VA agency, not
 

1655
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,990
course. All right, so the VA agency, not
to knock our VA friends, but it's no

1656
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
to knock our VA friends, but it's no
 

1657
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,909
to knock our VA friends, but it's no
secret that we're probably not far from

1658
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
secret that we're probably not far from
 

1659
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,950
secret that we're probably not far from
the point where a lot of normal VA tasks

1660
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
the point where a lot of normal VA tasks
 

1661
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,190
the point where a lot of normal VA tasks
are genuinely fully automatable and it's

1662
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
are genuinely fully automatable and it's
 

1663
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,190
are genuinely fully automatable and it's
affordable and it's cheaper than the 6

1664
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
affordable and it's cheaper than the 6
 

1665
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,230
affordable and it's cheaper than the 6
to 10 bucks an hour that you'd spend. So

1666
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240
to 10 bucks an hour that you'd spend. So
 

1667
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,149
to 10 bucks an hour that you'd spend. So
the opportunity here is the assistance

1668
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
the opportunity here is the assistance
 

1669
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,230
the opportunity here is the assistance
in a box kind of like business in a box

1670
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,240
in a box kind of like business in a box
 

1671
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,630
in a box kind of like business in a box
but imagine you have let's say a

1672
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
but imagine you have let's say a
 

1673
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,870
but imagine you have let's say a

world. But yeah, like the theoretical
 

1713
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,230
world. But yeah, like the theoretical
thing is if you can figure out how to

1714
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
thing is if you can figure out how to
 

1715
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,750
thing is if you can figure out how to
make this genuinely useful, like

1716
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
make this genuinely useful, like
 

1717
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,430
make this genuinely useful, like
everything I'm showing you here, right?

1718
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
everything I'm showing you here, right?
 

1719
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,710
everything I'm showing you here, right?
I want to pull this from my other screen

1720
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
I want to pull this from my other screen
 

1721
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,789
I want to pull this from my other screen
because I think it's useful. one year

1722
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:18,799
because I think it's useful. one year
 

1723
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,870
because I think it's useful. one year
ago almost like to the day. If I just

1724
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
ago almost like to the day. If I just
 

1725
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,070
ago almost like to the day. If I just
refresh this bad boy and we take a look

1726
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
refresh this bad boy and we take a look
 

1727
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,549
refresh this bad boy and we take a look
at this, like this was the hottest thing

1728
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
at this, like this was the hottest thing
 

1729
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,870
at this, like this was the hottest thing
on YouTube, which is the nadn Jarvis

1730
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
on YouTube, which is the nadn Jarvis
 

1731
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,710
on YouTube, which is the nadn Jarvis
where you manually had to set up all

1732
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:32,720
where you manually had to set up all
 

1733
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,870
where you manually had to set up all
these agents, all these nodes. These

1734
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:34,880
these agents, all these nodes. These
 

1735
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,630
these agents, all these nodes. These
would break all the time as you wanted

1736
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
would break all the time as you wanted
 

1737
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,149
would break all the time as you wanted
to change things, but every time you

1738
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,159
to change things, but every time you
 

1739
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,230
to change things, but every time you
wanted to add something new, teach it

1740
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
wanted to add something new, teach it
 

1741
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,990
wanted to add something new, teach it
something, you can't teach it something.

1742
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
something, you can't teach it something.
 

1743
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,750
something, you can't teach it something.
You can only build it something that it

1744
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
You can only build it something that it
 

1745
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,149
You can only build it something that it
can learn. So, we're going from this

1746
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
can learn. So, we're going from this
 

1747
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,510
can learn. So, we're going from this
into a world that's a lot more

1748
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
into a world that's a lot more
 

1749
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,990
into a world that's a lot more
plentiful. And with that, you can upsell

1750
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
plentiful. And with that, you can upsell
 

1751
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,470
plentiful. And with that, you can upsell
adding skills, you can make those skills

1752
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
adding skills, you can make those skills
 

1753
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,990
adding skills, you can make those skills
like across the board. You can um upsell

1754
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
like across the board. You can um upsell
 

1755
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,830
like across the board. You can um upsell
maintenance, you can upsell future

1756
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:57,840
maintenance, you can upsell future
 

1757
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,070
maintenance, you can upsell future
proofing, all kinds of stuff.

1758
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
proofing, all kinds of stuff.
 

1759
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,750
proofing, all kinds of stuff.
>> I mean, you can use these if you have an

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
>> I mean, you can use these if you have an
 

1761
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,750

upfront setup fee. You charge them, you

1762
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760
upfront setup fee. You charge them, you
 

1763
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,630
upfront setup fee. You charge them, you
buy the Mac Mini, you set it up, uh, and

1764
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
buy the Mac Mini, you set it up, uh, and
 

1765
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,389
buy the Mac Mini, you set it up, uh, and
you have like a obviously an SOP on,

1766
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,399
you have like a obviously an SOP on,
 

1767
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,549
you have like a obviously an SOP on,
okay, we want the Ampify MCP plugged in

1768
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
okay, we want the Ampify MCP plugged in
 

1769
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,389
okay, we want the Ampify MCP plugged in
in a certain way. We want these default

1770
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
in a certain way. We want these default
 

1771
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,149
in a certain way. We want these default
skills out of the box. And you've got

1772
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
skills out of the box. And you've got
 

1773
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,149
skills out of the box. And you've got
like an SOP on how to set one of these

1774
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:16,159
like an SOP on how to set one of these
 

1775
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,350
like an SOP on how to set one of these
up. And then there's a bit of a teething

1776
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,360
up. And then there's a bit of a teething
 

1777
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,710
up. And then there's a bit of a teething
process to get them working on it.

1778
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:18,720
process to get them working on it.
 

1779
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,830
process to get them working on it.
You're setting up the telegram, you're

1780
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
You're setting up the telegram, you're
 

1781
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,990
You're setting up the telegram, you're
giving them access to it. Um, that's

1782
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
giving them access to it. Um, that's
 

1783
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,870
giving them access to it. Um, that's
that's repeatable. And I mean even

1784
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:24,880
that's repeatable. And I mean even
 

1785
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,110
that's repeatable. And I mean even
thinking about how you can add more

1786
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
thinking about how you can add more
 

1787
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,950
thinking about how you can add more
value to uh to them on top of that you

1788
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:28,960
value to uh to them on top of that you
 

1789
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,590
value to uh to them on top of that you
can have a hey I'm going to analyze your

1790
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:31,600
can have a hey I'm going to analyze your
 

1791
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,149
can have a hey I'm going to analyze your
transcripts occasionally whether you e

1792
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
transcripts occasionally whether you e
 

1793
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,310
transcripts occasionally whether you e
either create a skill that is almost

1794
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
either create a skill that is almost
 

1795
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,230
either create a skill that is almost
like a like a workflow tracer and it

1796
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,240
like a like a workflow tracer and it
 

1797
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,830
like a like a workflow tracer and it
will actually look back the conversation

1798
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
will actually look back the conversation
 

1799
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,350
will actually look back the conversation
figure out what it used and when and

1800
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
figure out what it used and when and
 

1801
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,830
figure out what it used and when and
then be able to like bake that into a

1802
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
then be able to like bake that into a
 

1803
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,750
then be able to like bake that into a
skill itself or like build it into some

1804
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
skill itself or like build it into some
 

1805
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,990
skill itself or like build it into some
sort of reusable workflow. so much to to

1806
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
sort of reusable workflow. so much to to
 

1807
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,070
sort of reusable workflow. so much to to
to build off of here, but I think you

1808
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,080
to build off of here, but I think you
 

1809
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,830
to build off of here, but I think you
guys can see the value in it. And before

1810
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,840
guys can see the value in it. And before
 

1811
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,110
guys can see the value in it. And before
you know it, like if each client is

1812
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
you know it, like if each client is
 

1813
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,029
you know it, like if each client is
paying 2K setup and then in a recurring

1814
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
paying 2K setup and then in a recurring
 

1815
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,070
paying 2K setup and then in a recurring
fee, $500 or $1,000 a month, um you can

1816
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
fee, $500 or $1,000 a month, um you can
 

1817
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,789
fee, $500 or $1,000 a month, um you can
very quickly spawn that whole like the

1818
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
very quickly spawn that whole like the
 

1819
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,029
very quickly spawn that whole like the
whole room or or warehouse full of Mac

1820
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
whole room or or warehouse full of Mac
 

1821
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,110
whole room or or warehouse full of Mac
monies running for your clients.

1822
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,120

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
Basically, this is the in future we're
 

1855
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,990
Basically, this is the in future we're
going to be relying pretty heavily on on

1856
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
going to be relying pretty heavily on on
 

1857
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,750
going to be relying pretty heavily on on
these these kinds of personal assistants

1858
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:43,760
these these kinds of personal assistants
 

1859
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,549
these these kinds of personal assistants
and the adding of skills. Uh we had we

1860
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
and the adding of skills. Uh we had we
 

1861
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,789
and the adding of skills. Uh we had we
once had MCPs. Uh we had chat GBT

1862
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:48,799
once had MCPs. Uh we had chat GBT
 

1863
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,909
once had MCPs. Uh we had chat GBT
plugins. Like all of these are just

1864
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:49,919
plugins. Like all of these are just
 

1865
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,310
plugins. Like all of these are just
attempts for platforms and providers and

1866
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
attempts for platforms and providers and
 

1867
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,990
attempts for platforms and providers and
SAS products to be able to hook into the

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,000
SAS products to be able to hook into the
 

1869
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,149
SAS products to be able to hook into the
chat interface in a in an easy way and

chat interface in a in an easy way and
 

1871
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,430
chat interface in a in an easy way and
give access to the functionality that

1872
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
give access to the functionality that
 

1873
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,470
give access to the functionality that
they've built their backend

1874
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480

focus on. How can I make that as
 

1977
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,870
focus on. How can I make that as
valuable as possible? And just make that

1978
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:36,880
valuable as possible? And just make that
 

1979
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,310
valuable as possible? And just make that
available to some agents like this where

1980
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
available to some agents like this where

1983
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,669
I'm getting listed on a marketplace

1985

real real opportunity here finally and I

real real opportunity here finally and I
 

1987

real real opportunity here finally and I
think it's massively reduced the

don't want to cap and say that, but what

2010
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
don't want to cap and say that, but what
 

2011
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,750
don't want to cap and say that, but what
we could say is this is the beginning of

2012
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:09,760
we could say is this is the beginning of
 

2013
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,909
we could say is this is the beginning of
a brand new expectation from the

2014
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
a brand new expectation from the
 

2015
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,310
a brand new expectation from the
consumer. Meaning once this really gets

2016
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,320
consumer. Meaning once this really gets
 

2017
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,750
consumer. Meaning once this really gets
into mainstream, it's already going

2018
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,760
into mainstream, it's already going
 

2019
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,909
into mainstream, it's already going
viral. The expectation of what a

2020
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
viral. The expectation of what a
 

2021
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,149
viral. The expectation of what a
personal assistant is is going to be

2022
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:20,159
personal assistant is is going to be
 

2023
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,870
personal assistant is is going to be
much higher. So when Siri uses Gemini, I

2024
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
much higher. So when Siri uses Gemini, I
 

2025
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,909
much higher. So when Siri uses Gemini, I
think this year they're going to like

2026
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:23,919
think this year they're going to like
 

2027
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,990
think this year they're going to like
work together and next year we have

2028
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
work together and next year we have
 

2029
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,909
work together and next year we have
laptops, people will start asking the

2030
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
laptops, people will start asking the
 

2031
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,310
laptops, people will start asking the
question, why is Siri just a voice

2032
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320
question, why is Siri just a voice
 

2033
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,310
question, why is Siri just a voice
thing? Why can't she interact with

2034
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,320
thing? Why can't she interact with
 

2035
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,389
thing? Why can't she interact with
everything and do X, Y, and Z? So

2036
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:34,399
everything and do X, Y, and Z? So
 

2037
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,710
everything and do X, Y, and Z? So
expectations from the consumer will

2038
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:36,720
expectations from the consumer will
 

2039
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,549
expectations from the consumer will
change from this point onwards.

2040
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:38,559
change from this point onwards.
 

2041

This seems to be like the the new
frontier on that. So yeah, it's just

2130
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
frontier on that. So yeah, it's just
 

2131
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,550
frontier on that. So yeah, it's just
it's so great to be in this phase now. I

2132
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
it's so great to be in this phase now. I
 

2133
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,390
it's so great to be in this phase now. I
think uh last year was a little bit

2134
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,400
think uh last year was a little bit
 

2135
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,069
think uh last year was a little bit
slow, but I feel like we're absolutely

2136
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,079
slow, but I feel like we're absolutely
 

2137
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,390
slow, but I feel like we're absolutely
like cooking this year on new releases

2138
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
like cooking this year on new releases
 

2139
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,230
like cooking this year on new releases
and I'm so excited for uh for what's to

2140
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,240
and I'm so excited for uh for what's to
 

2141
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,430
and I'm so excited for uh for what's to
come this year based off what we've had

2142
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
come this year based off what we've had
 

2143
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,750
come this year based off what we've had
already.

2144
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,760
already.
 

2145
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,510
already.
>> Yeah, it's already not even the end of

2146
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
>> Yeah, it's already not even the end of
 

2147
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,990
>> Yeah, it's already not even the end of
2026 and it feels like it's been a year.

2148
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
2026 and it feels like it's been a year.
 

2149
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,550
2026 and it feels like it's been a year.
So especially on the education side, you

2150
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:24,560
So especially on the education side, you
 

2151
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,550
So especially on the education side, you
could have taught Claude code alone.

2152
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
could have taught Claude code alone.
 

2153
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,550
could have taught Claude code alone.
Then a week later, you could teach cloud

2154
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
Then a week later, you could teach cloud
 

2155
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,069
Then a week later, you could teach cloud
code and co-work. And now you could

2156
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:30,079
code and co-work. And now you could
 

2157
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,910
code and co-work. And now you could
teach cloud code, co-work, and cloudbot.

2158
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
teach cloud code, co-work, and cloudbot.
 

2159
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,790
teach cloud code, co-work, and cloudbot.
And then you could probably keep

2160
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:32,800
And then you could probably keep
 

2161
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,550
And then you could probably keep
stacking on top of that. So

2162
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
stacking on top of that. So
 

2163
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,310
stacking on top of that. So
>> the education piece is is huge and like

2164
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,320
>> the education piece is is huge and like
 

2165
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,230
>> the education piece is is huge and like
as the stuff runs off further into the

2166
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,240
as the stuff runs off further into the
 

2167
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,630
as the stuff runs off further into the
distance, companies are still in the

2168
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,640
distance, companies are still in the
 

2169
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,349
distance, companies are still in the
same spot and the the amount of like

2170
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:43,359
same spot and the the amount of like
 

2171
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,190
same spot and the the amount of like
monetizable space between where the tech

2172
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
monetizable space between where the tech
 

2173
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,190
monetizable space between where the tech
is and where these companies are. The

2174
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,200
is and where these companies are. The
 

2175
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,190
is and where these companies are. The
same the automation that was available

2176
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
same the automation that was available
 

2177
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,190
same the automation that was available
in sort of mid 2023 that like millions

2178
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
in sort of mid 2023 that like millions
 

2179
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,630
in sort of mid 2023 that like millions
of businesses still need is is still

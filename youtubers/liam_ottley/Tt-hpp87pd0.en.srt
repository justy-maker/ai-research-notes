make videos with those and from them you
 

81
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,910
make videos with those and from them you
can use reotion to stitch them all

82

can use reotion to stitch them all
 

83
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,830
can use reotion to stitch them all
together and make really cinematic shots

together and make really cinematic shots
 

85
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,469
together and make really cinematic shots
and videos as well right and then people

86
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
and videos as well right and then people
 

87
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,310

>> Right. that's starting to make a bit of
 

125
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,150
>> Right. that's starting to make a bit of
sense. But like, so we have the raw

126
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
sense. But like, so we have the raw
 

127
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,869
sense. But like, so we have the raw
elements of a video, right? Say it's the

128
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
elements of a video, right? Say it's the
 

129
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,190
elements of a video, right? Say it's the
it's the the footage of like an A-roll

130
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
it's the the footage of like an A-roll
 

131
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,190
it's the the footage of like an A-roll
of say this a YouTube video that I'm

132
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
of say this a YouTube video that I'm
 

133
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,589
of say this a YouTube video that I'm
filming or it's uh the animations that

134
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
filming or it's uh the animations that
 

135
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,430
filming or it's uh the animations that
go on top, it's the the music, the sound

136
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
go on top, it's the the music, the sound
 

137
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,790
go on top, it's the the music, the sound
effects. Is all of that stuff taken care

138
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
effects. Is all of that stuff taken care
 

139
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,790
effects. Is all of that stuff taken care
of here or is it mainly just for

140
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
of here or is it mainly just for
 

141
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,470
of here or is it mainly just for
basically I have some video files. I can

142
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
basically I have some video files. I can
 

143
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,270
basically I have some video files. I can
now play around with them

144
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
now play around with them
 

145
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,869
now play around with them
programmatically and determine how they

146
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
programmatically and determine how they
 

147
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,110
programmatically and determine how they
get kind of stitched together. And how

148
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
get kind of stitched together. And how
 

149
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,110
get kind of stitched together. And how
does it handle layering on top? So say I

150
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
does it handle layering on top? So say I
 

151
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,790
does it handle layering on top? So say I
have footage on the background like that

152
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
have footage on the background like that
 

153
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,190
have footage on the background like that
space scene. How does it then put

154
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
space scene. How does it then put
 

155
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,869
space scene. How does it then put
animations on top of that?

156
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
animations on top of that?
 

157
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,949
animations on top of that?
>> Yeah. So ultimately if you think about

158
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
>> Yeah. So ultimately if you think about
 

159
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,710
>> Yeah. So ultimately if you think about
it um what are the video editors doing

160
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
it um what are the video editors doing
 

161
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,110
it um what are the video editors doing
right and video editors in the back end

162
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
right and video editors in the back end
 

163
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,350
right and video editors in the back end
is just code. So what you can do with

164
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
is just code. So what you can do with
 

165
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,830
is just code. So what you can do with
reotion is when you set up a cloud

166
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
reotion is when you set up a cloud
 

167
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,190
reotion is when you set up a cloud
project let's say you dump in all your

168
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
project let's say you dump in all your
 

169
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,350
project let's say you dump in all your
let's say your a-roll your other uh stat

170

let's say your a-roll your other uh stat
 

171
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,149
let's say your a-roll your other uh stat
uh other assets like for example here um

172
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
uh other assets like for example here um
 

173
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,990
uh other assets like for example here um
like it actually just like scraped

174
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
like it actually just like scraped
 

175
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,869

00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
Liam's your Liam your face and your
 

177
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,270
Liam's your Liam your face and your
stuff and put it in there. So it can

178
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
stuff and put it in there. So it can
 

179
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,589
stuff and put it in there. So it can
actually take these things from inside

180
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
actually take these things from inside
 

181
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,990
actually take these things from inside
your project because claude can you know

182
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000

183
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,270
your project because claude can you know
see your assets and embed it where you

184
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
see your assets and embed it where you
 

185
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,190
see your assets and embed it where you
need to. So for example, let's say you

186
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
need to. So for example, let's say you
 

187
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,270
need to. So for example, let's say you
have a video of yourself here like this

188
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
have a video of yourself here like this
 

189
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,270
have a video of yourself here like this
hijen one. You could just be like hey

190
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
hijen one. You could just be like hey
 

191
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,430
hijen one. You could just be like hey
can put me on the right and what

192
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
can put me on the right and what
 

193
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,550
can put me on the right and what
remotion does is give yourself the

remotion does is give yourself the
 

195
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,309
remotion does is give yourself the
positioning and layering so you can put

196
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
positioning and layering so you can put
 

197
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,830
positioning and layering so you can put
yourself on the right or wherever you

198
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
yourself on the right or wherever you
 

199
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,589
yourself on the right or wherever you
need to. It's essentially like a

200
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
need to. It's essentially like a
 

201
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,350
need to. It's essentially like a
codebased video editor if you think

202
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
codebased video editor if you think
 

203
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,430
codebased video editor if you think
about it. Remotion that's all that is.

204
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
about it. Remotion that's all that is.
 

205
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,789
about it. Remotion that's all that is.

there any other theory we need to know

240
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
there any other theory we need to know
 

241
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,990
there any other theory we need to know
before we like jump into into playing

242
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
before we like jump into into playing
 

243
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,990
before we like jump into into playing
around with this? Only other theory we

244
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
around with this? Only other theory we
 

245
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,149
around with this? Only other theory we
need to know is there are some best

246
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
need to know is there are some best
 

247
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,390
need to know is there are some best
practices into using it. And the way we

248
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
practices into using it. And the way we
 

249
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,349
practices into using it. And the way we
do that is by teaching Claude a skill.

250
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
do that is by teaching Claude a skill.
 

251
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,349
do that is by teaching Claude a skill.
And what a skill kind of is and how it

252
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
And what a skill kind of is and how it
 

253
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,310
And what a skill kind of is and how it
works is essentially like this. Um Liam,

254
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
works is essentially like this. Um Liam,
 

255
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,749
works is essentially like this. Um Liam,
hopefully you're also a big fan of

256
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
hopefully you're also a big fan of
 

257
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,950
hopefully you're also a big fan of
Pokemon like I am.

258
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
Pokemon like I am.
 

259
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,710
Pokemon like I am.
>> Yeah, this makes sense.

260
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
>> Yeah, this makes sense.
 

261
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,430
>> Yeah, this makes sense.
>> Yeah. So, what we're kind of doing is

262
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
>> Yeah. So, what we're kind of doing is
 

263
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,870
>> Yeah. So, what we're kind of doing is
like right here in Pokemon when we need

264
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
like right here in Pokemon when we need
 

265
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,230
like right here in Pokemon when we need
to, let's say, get through water or get

266
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
to, let's say, get through water or get
 

267
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,749
to, let's say, get through water or get
through a tree, we would teach our

268
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
through a tree, we would teach our
 

269
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,790
through a tree, we would teach our
Pokemon a skill like cut or surf, right?

270
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
Pokemon a skill like cut or surf, right?
 

271
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,590
Pokemon a skill like cut or surf, right?
In the same way, you can teach Claude

272
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
In the same way, you can teach Claude
 

273
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,870
In the same way, you can teach Claude
other skills like, "Hey, here's your

274
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
other skills like, "Hey, here's your
 

275
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,310
other skills like, "Hey, here's your
video editing skill, and you're going to

276
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
video editing skill, and you're going to
 

277
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,550
video editing skill, and you're going to
be using Remotion to do that, right?"

278
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
be using Remotion to do that, right?"
 

279
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,510
be using Remotion to do that, right?"
So, we teach them the skill and then

280
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
So, we teach them the skill and then
 

281
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,990
So, we teach them the skill and then
after Claude learns the skill, it can

282
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
after Claude learns the skill, it can
 

283
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,990
after Claude learns the skill, it can
start doing these things. And it's

284
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
start doing these things. And it's
 

285
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,749
start doing these things. And it's
really easy to, for example, like this

286
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
really easy to, for example, like this
 

287
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,390
really easy to, for example, like this
TM install these skills because it's

TM install these skills because it's
 

289
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,029
TM install these skills because it's
kind of like if you've ever played GTA,

290
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
kind of like if you've ever played GTA,

it's kind of like you just having to
 

293
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,670
it's kind of like you just having to
enter a cheat code into Claude and then

294
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
enter a cheat code into Claude and then
 

295
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,350
enter a cheat code into Claude and then
it kind of just learned the skill on its

296
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
it kind of just learned the skill on its
 

297
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,590
it kind of just learned the skill on its
own.

298
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
own.
 

299
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,510
own.

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
guys. Um, these are what you just need
 

313
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,550
guys. Um, these are what you just need
to enter into Claude and it will just

314
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
to enter into Claude and it will just
 

315
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,909
to enter into Claude and it will just
learn all of it, right? And, you know,

316
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
learn all of it, right? And, you know,
 

317
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,150
learn all of it, right? And, you know,
we can get into actually building one

318
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
we can get into actually building one
 

319
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,710
we can get into actually building one
live. So, it's going to be a lot easier

320
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
live. So, it's going to be a lot easier
 

321
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,710
live. So, it's going to be a lot easier
to follow along. And you know when we

322
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
to follow along. And you know when we
 

323
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,550
to follow along. And you know when we
want to build this stuff all we have to

324
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
want to build this stuff all we have to
 

325
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,550
want to build this stuff all we have to
do just because and this is why it's so

326
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
do just because and this is why it's so
 

327
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,710
do just because and this is why it's so
cool is because the barrier of entry is

328
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
cool is because the barrier of entry is
 

329
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,710
cool is because the barrier of entry is
getting lower and lower because all you

330
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
getting lower and lower because all you
 

331
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,310
getting lower and lower because all you
would have to do is just go to your

332
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
would have to do is just go to your
 

333
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,350
would have to do is just go to your
cloud desktop app and type into this

334
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
cloud desktop app and type into this
 

335
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,189
cloud desktop app and type into this
little chat box and that's all you need

336
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
little chat box and that's all you need
 

337
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,830
little chat box and that's all you need
to do. So let me start doing that. I

338
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
to do. So let me start doing that. I
 

339
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,790
to do. So let me start doing that. I
just opened up claw desktop. So what I'm

340
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
just opened up claw desktop. So what I'm
 

341
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,230
just opened up claw desktop. So what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to make a

342
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
going to do now is I'm going to make a
 

343
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,909
going to do now is I'm going to make a
new folder and I'm going to call this

344
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
new folder and I'm going to call this
 

345
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,710
new folder and I'm going to call this
folder let's say remotion Liam.

346
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
folder let's say remotion Liam.
 

347
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,629
folder let's say remotion Liam.
I'm going create this and open it. So,

348
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
I'm going create this and open it. So,
 

349
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,710
I'm going create this and open it. So,
what we're doing right here is we're

350
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
what we're doing right here is we're
 

351
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,029
what we're doing right here is we're
kind of telling Claude to build any

352
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
kind of telling Claude to build any
 

353
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,990
kind of telling Claude to build any
videos that it needs to or whatever it

354
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
videos that it needs to or whatever it
 

355
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,909
videos that it needs to or whatever it
needs to do in here. So, you're actually

356
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
needs to do in here. So, you're actually
 

357
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,510
needs to do in here. So, you're actually
really focused. And if you're curious

358
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
really focused. And if you're curious
 

359
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,510
really focused. And if you're curious
how to get here is all you need to do is

360
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
how to get here is all you need to do is
 

361
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,870
how to get here is all you need to do is
when you're in the Cloud app, you just

362
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
when you're in the Cloud app, you just
 

363
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,390
when you're in the Cloud app, you just
hit this code button and you're good to

364
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
hit this code button and you're good to
 

365
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,309
hit this code button and you're good to
go. That's all you need to do. So, this

366
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
go. That's all you need to do. So, this
 

367
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,990
go. That's all you need to do. So, this
is just an easier way of using cloud

368
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
is just an easier way of using cloud
 

369
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,830
is just an easier way of using cloud
code. All right. And then what we want

370
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
code. All right. And then what we want
 

371
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,590
code. All right. And then what we want
to do is I'm just going to move this one

372
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
to do is I'm just going to move this one
 

373
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,309
to do is I'm just going to move this one
second. And I'm going to grab this thing

374
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
second. And I'm going to grab this thing
 

375
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,469
second. And I'm going to grab this thing
right here. All right.

376
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
right here. All right.
 

377
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,950
right here. All right.
Right here. I'm going to paste this. And

378
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
Right here. I'm going to paste this. And
 

379
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,590
Right here. I'm going to paste this. And
this is a skill. So now it gets really

380
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
this is a skill. So now it gets really
 

381
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,510
this is a skill. So now it gets really
easy. This was the hard part. Now I'm

382
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
easy. This was the hard part. Now I'm
 

383
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,430
easy. This was the hard part. Now I'm
just going to speak to Claude like,

384
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
just going to speak to Claude like,
 

385
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,029
just going to speak to Claude like,
"Hey,

386
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
"Hey,
 

387
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,390
"Hey,
um, I'm trying to create a video for

388
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
um, I'm trying to create a video for
 

389
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,909
um, I'm trying to create a video for
Liam's AAA accelerator. Can you go out

390
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
Liam's AAA accelerator. Can you go out
 

391
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,749
Liam's AAA accelerator. Can you go out
to the web? Can you search for Liam's

392
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
to the web? Can you search for Liam's
 

393
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,510
to the web? Can you search for Liam's
AAA accelerator, get all his colors,

394
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
AAA accelerator, get all his colors,
 

395
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,749
AAA accelerator, get all his colors,
branding, and all that, and then make an

396
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
branding, and all that, and then make an
 

397
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,309
branding, and all that, and then make an
explainer video on what it really is.

398
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
explainer video on what it really is.
 

399
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,909
explainer video on what it really is.
But first, before you do that, I want

400
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
But first, before you do that, I want
 

401
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,230
But first, before you do that, I want
you to install the skill I have for you

402
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
you to install the skill I have for you
 

403
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,870
you to install the skill I have for you
above and then with Remotion, I want you

404
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
above and then with Remotion, I want you
 

405
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,629
above and then with Remotion, I want you
to create that project and give it to

406
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
to create that project and give it to
 

407
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,469
to create that project and give it to
me. All right.

408
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479

 

409
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,350

So, after I did that, uh there is I had

410
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
So, after I did that, uh there is I had
 

411
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,990
So, after I did that, uh there is I had
this ask thing because there's ask,

412
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
this ask thing because there's ask,
 

413
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,830
this ask thing because there's ask,
code, and plan. And intentionally I was

414
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
code, and plan. And intentionally I was
 

415
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,469
code, and plan. And intentionally I was
really vague with this prompt. So I want

416
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
really vague with this prompt. So I want
 

417
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,390
really vague with this prompt. So I want
to see where it messes up if it does.

418
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
to see where it messes up if it does.
 

419
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,150
to see where it messes up if it does.
But right here after I just put it to

420
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
But right here after I just put it to
 

421
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,309
But right here after I just put it to
code so it doesn't ask me for random

422
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
code so it doesn't ask me for random
 

423
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,830
code so it doesn't ask me for random
stuff. And then I'm just going to hit

424
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
stuff. And then I'm just going to hit
 

425
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,270
stuff. And then I'm just going to hit
go. And then I'm going to trust this

426
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
go. And then I'm going to trust this
 

427
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,189
go. And then I'm going to trust this
workspace. And you see it just all it

428
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
workspace. And you see it just all it
 

429
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,029
workspace. And you see it just all it
does it just asks you for permission

430
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
does it just asks you for permission
 

431
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,909
does it just asks you for permission
over and over. So first it installs the

432
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
over and over. So first it installs the
 

433
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,710
over and over. So first it installs the
reotion skill.

434
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
reotion skill.
 

435
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,270
reotion skill.
Boom. Installation failed. Okay cool.

436
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
Boom. Installation failed. Okay cool.
 

437
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,350
Boom. Installation failed. Okay cool.
And now it's going to keep doing it

438
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
And now it's going to keep doing it
 

439
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,309
And now it's going to keep doing it
trying new stuff.

440
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
trying new stuff.
 

441
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,830
trying new stuff.
>> Damn. So this is I guess the move for

442
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
>> Damn. So this is I guess the move for
 

443
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,909
>> Damn. So this is I guess the move for
with it like the the clawed codification

444
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
with it like the the clawed codification
 

445
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,589
with it like the the clawed codification
of of everything which is kind of what

446
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
of of everything which is kind of what
 

447
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,749
of of everything which is kind of what
we're going through here for startups to

448
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
we're going through here for startups to
 

449
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,670
we're going through here for startups to
be able to create some functionality

450
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
be able to create some functionality
 

451
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,790
be able to create some functionality
that builds on top of or gives a very

452
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
that builds on top of or gives a very
 

453
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,070
that builds on top of or gives a very
powerful new use case to claude code I

454
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
powerful new use case to claude code I
 

455
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,390
powerful new use case to claude code I
suppose is the move but I suppose

456
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
suppose is the move but I suppose
 

457
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,469
suppose is the move but I suppose
there's only a certain number of these

458
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
there's only a certain number of these
 

459
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,790
there's only a certain number of these
major areas like this that are that are

460
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
major areas like this that are that are
 

461
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,469
major areas like this that are that are
yet to be tapped right so the video

462
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
yet to be tapped right so the video
 

463
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,390
yet to be tapped right so the video

these AI models like Claude, GPT,
Gemini, they invest so heavily into code

478
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
Gemini, they invest so heavily into code
 

479
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,670
Gemini, they invest so heavily into code
and their models being able to code

480
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
and their models being able to code
 

481
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,509
and their models being able to code
stuff. It's it's the reason is

482
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
stuff. It's it's the reason is
 

483
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,509
stuff. It's it's the reason is
essentially because if you can code, you

484
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
essentially because if you can code, you
 

485
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,870
essentially because if you can code, you
can technically do everything on a

486
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
can technically do everything on a
 

487
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,190
can technically do everything on a
computer, right? Because everything on

488
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
computer, right? Because everything on
 

489
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,550
computer, right? Because everything on
the computer is ones and zeros is just

490
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
the computer is ones and zeros is just
 

491
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,870
the computer is ones and zeros is just
code. And if you can get that good

492
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
code. And if you can get that good
 

493
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,750
code. And if you can get that good
enough, you can just have autonomous

494
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
enough, you can just have autonomous
 

495
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,430
enough, you can just have autonomous
people like like what we're doing with

496
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
people like like what we're doing with
 

497
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,430
people like like what we're doing with
our hands and and our keyboards and

498
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
our hands and and our keyboards and
 

499
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,590
our hands and and our keyboards and
eyes. You can do that and get your

500
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
eyes. You can do that and get your
 

501
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,350
eyes. You can do that and get your
computer to do ultimately anything you

502
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
computer to do ultimately anything you
 

503
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,750
computer to do ultimately anything you
want. So yeah, that's pretty much it.

504
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
want. So yeah, that's pretty much it.
 

505
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,110
want. So yeah, that's pretty much it.
You just learn cloud code. You just

You just learn cloud code. You just
 

507
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,389
You just learn cloud code. You just
learn to prompt a little bit and you're

508
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
learn to prompt a little bit and you're
 

509
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,870
learn to prompt a little bit and you're
good to go.

510
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
good to go.

like building a SAS and future does come

00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
like building a SAS and future does come

down to depending on if you actually

down to depending on if you actually
 

519
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,150
down to depending on if you actually
need to access the interface or not. But

520
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
need to access the interface or not. But
 

521
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,310
need to access the interface or not. But
it's like creating these

522
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
it's like creating these
 

523
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,509
it's like creating these
functions or external like specific

everything from or or chatbt and kind of
 

537
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,670
everything from or or chatbt and kind of
like how we had chatbt plugins like

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
like how we had chatbt plugins like
 

539
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,350
like how we had chatbt plugins like
forever ago and that that seemed to be

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
forever ago and that that seemed to be
 

541
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,949
forever ago and that that seemed to be
like the direction it would move. seems

542
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
like the direction it would move. seems
 

543
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,630
like the direction it would move. seems
like we've finally come full circle on

544
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
like we've finally come full circle on
 

545
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,430
like we've finally come full circle on
on that being the case where as a as a

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
on that being the case where as a as a
 

547
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,509
on that being the case where as a as a
software uh like a SAS platform, you

548
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
software uh like a SAS platform, you
 

549
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,350
software uh like a SAS platform, you
want to be able to build a key a set of

550
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
want to be able to build a key a set of
 

551
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,110
want to be able to build a key a set of
key functionalities that can plug into

552
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
key functionalities that can plug into
 

553
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,910
key functionalities that can plug into
this and then people won't actually be

554
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
this and then people won't actually be
 

555
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,110
this and then people won't actually be
using it on your site. They'll just be

556
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
using it on your site. They'll just be
 

557
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,470
using it on your site. They'll just be
paying for the subscription for cloud to

558
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
paying for the subscription for cloud to
 

559
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,829
paying for the subscription for cloud to
be able to hook into it. That's actually

560
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
be able to hook into it. That's actually
 

561
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,750
be able to hook into it. That's actually
really good point because like A6 A16Z

562
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
really good point because like A6 A16Z
 

563
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,910
really good point because like A6 A16Z
they have been investing really heavily

564
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
they have been investing really heavily
 

565
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,870
they have been investing really heavily
into the the future of the web and they

566
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
into the the future of the web and they
 

567
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,269
into the the future of the web and they
kind of see it as being kind of aic. So

568
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
kind of see it as being kind of aic. So
 

569
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,150
kind of see it as being kind of aic. So
for example like right now to buy a

570
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
for example like right now to buy a
 

571
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,790
for example like right now to buy a
plane ticket um for our Africa uh South

572
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
plane ticket um for our Africa uh South
 

573
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,750
plane ticket um for our Africa uh South
Africa event Liam um I would have to go

574
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
Africa event Liam um I would have to go
 

575
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,310
Africa event Liam um I would have to go
to Google flights find the best flights

576
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
to Google flights find the best flights
 

577
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,190
to Google flights find the best flights
and then go buy it right what A16Z is

578
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
and then go buy it right what A16Z is
 

579
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,430
and then go buy it right what A16Z is
predicting is the future of the web is

580
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
predicting is the future of the web is
 

581
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,350
predicting is the future of the web is
more agentic based so they won't be

582
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
more agentic based so they won't be
 

583
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,509
more agentic based so they won't be
building UIs and stuff anymore but more

584
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
building UIs and stuff anymore but more
 

585
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,550
building UIs and stuff anymore but more
so like creating websites and apps so

586
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
so like creating websites and apps so
 

587
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,829
so like creating websites and apps so
that other agents can use them and the

588
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
that other agents can use them and the
 

589
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,350
that other agents can use them and the
reason they're doing that is because

590
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
reason they're doing that is because
 

591
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,550
reason they're doing that is because
that's kind of what's happening right

592
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
that's kind of what's happening right
 

593
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,710
that's kind of what's happening right
No, I don't really care as long as I get

finetuning uh parts of it.
 

645
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,030
finetuning uh parts of it.
>> It's just a matter of time until they

646
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
>> It's just a matter of time until they
 

647
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,870
>> It's just a matter of time until they
add in the layers and layers of UI that

648
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
add in the layers and layers of UI that
 

649
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,630
add in the layers and layers of UI that
are needed. Yeah. To do these to to do

this kind of stuff.
>> So yeah. So I was actually playing with

654
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
>> So yeah. So I was actually playing with
 

655
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,870
>> So yeah. So I was actually playing with
this a while back. So you see this is

656
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
this a while back. So you see this is
 

657
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,430
this a while back. So you see this is
how it gets generated right.

658
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
how it gets generated right.
 

659
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,470
how it gets generated right.
>> So this is on remotion itself. This is

660

>> Yes, this is Remotion. Oh, this is like
a voice over, but this is Remotion

664
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
a voice over, but this is Remotion
 

665
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,670
a voice over, but this is Remotion
running locally. And you see there is a

666
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
running locally. And you see there is a
 

667
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,110
running locally. And you see there is a
little video editor that you can mess

668
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
little video editor that you can mess
 

669
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,590
little video editor that you can mess
with. Um, you can render your videos.

And then there's even like a little
 

673
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,230
And then there's even like a little
place for your assets. So, right here,

674
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
place for your assets. So, right here,
 

675
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,389
place for your assets. So, right here,
you'll see, you know, this is your logo.

It went and scraped all of it. I didn't
 

681
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,949
It went and scraped all of it. I didn't
do any of this. And then there's a voice

682
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
do any of this. And then there's a voice
 

683
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,670
do any of this. And then there's a voice
over.

684
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
over.
 

685
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,750
over.
>> So, it stitched all these together. Uh,

686
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
>> So, it stitched all these together. Uh,
 

687
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,829
>> So, it stitched all these together. Uh,
to when you mentioned the assets for the

688
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
to when you mentioned the assets for the
 

689
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,910
to when you mentioned the assets for the
videos, this is just just about it. It

690
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
videos, this is just just about it. It
 

691
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,150
videos, this is just just about it. It
keeps it here. It uses the assets to

692
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
keeps it here. It uses the assets to
 

693
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,629
keeps it here. It uses the assets to
generate the videos. And you know, if

694
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
generate the videos. And you know, if
 

695
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,430
generate the videos. And you know, if
you really want, you can get in and then

696
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
you really want, you can get in and then
 

697
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,509
you really want, you can get in and then
adjust the nitty-gritty of it. But you

698
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
adjust the nitty-gritty of it. But you
 

699
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,269
adjust the nitty-gritty of it. But you
can also do that by just prompting. I

700
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
can also do that by just prompting. I
 

701
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,670
can also do that by just prompting. I
always think back to like the uh the

702
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
always think back to like the uh the
 

703
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,350
always think back to like the uh the
instantly use case. If you're setting up

704
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
instantly use case. If you're setting up
 

705
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,269
instantly use case. If you're setting up
like a a cold email campaign,

706
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
like a a cold email campaign,
 

707
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,190
like a a cold email campaign,
>> like what's at a certain point, what is

708
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
>> like what's at a certain point, what is
 

709
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,910
>> like what's at a certain point, what is
the actual value of me going onto the

710
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
the actual value of me going onto the
 

711
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,269
the actual value of me going onto the
platform and making like a dozen clicks

712
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
platform and making like a dozen clicks
 

713
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,949
platform and making like a dozen clicks
to set up a new campaign? I should be

714
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
to set up a new campaign? I should be
 

715
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,350
to set up a new campaign? I should be
able to have my my clawude console kind

716
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
able to have my my clawude console kind
 

717
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,430
able to have my my clawude console kind
of workspace here and saying, "Hey,

718
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
of workspace here and saying, "Hey,
 

719
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,030
of workspace here and saying, "Hey,
let's look at the marketing number that

720
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
let's look at the marketing number that

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,230
let's look at the marketing number that
numbers that have come back from the

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
numbers that have come back from the
 

723
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,750
numbers that have come back from the
last campaign. Let's look at the new

724
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
last campaign. Let's look at the new
 

725
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,110
last campaign. Let's look at the new
strategy that we're rolling out for this

726
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
strategy that we're rolling out for this
 

727
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,030
strategy that we're rolling out for this
quarter. Let me pull that data. Let me

728
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
quarter. Let me pull that data. Let me
 

729
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,150
quarter. Let me pull that data. Let me
look at the strategy. Let me come up

730
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
look at the strategy. Let me come up
 

731
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,910
look at the strategy. Let me come up
with a new strategy. Plan out a whole

732
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
with a new strategy. Plan out a whole
 

733
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,910
with a new strategy. Plan out a whole
new campaign, new copy for the emails,

734
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
new campaign, new copy for the emails,
 

735
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,389
new campaign, new copy for the emails,
new AB test planning, and then just use

736
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
new AB test planning, and then just use
 

737
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,030
new AB test planning, and then just use
like a an instantly tool or integration

738
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
like a an instantly tool or integration
 

739
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,949
like a an instantly tool or integration
to be able to set up that campaign and

740
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
to be able to set up that campaign and
 

741
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,629
to be able to set up that campaign and
basically give the all clear on it all

742
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
basically give the all clear on it all
 

743
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,470
basically give the all clear on it all
from just in the chat interface. So the

744
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
from just in the chat interface. So the
 

745
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,629
from just in the chat interface. So the
the SAS platform becomes like the power

746
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
the SAS platform becomes like the power
 

747
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,030
the SAS platform becomes like the power
of of instantly would be that it can uh

748
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
of of instantly would be that it can uh
 

749
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,790
of of instantly would be that it can uh
push those cold email campaigns at at

750
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
push those cold email campaigns at at
 

751
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,629
push those cold email campaigns at at
scale and provide you with the uh the

752
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
scale and provide you with the uh the
 

753
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,470
scale and provide you with the uh the
email sending like domains and accounts.

754
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
email sending like domains and accounts.
 

755
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,389
email sending like domains and accounts.

because we were actually in the middle

758
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
because we were actually in the middle
 

759
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,310
because we were actually in the middle
of and this is done through like these

760
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
of and this is done through like these
 

761
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,710
of and this is done through like these
connectors and MCPs and we were

762
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
connectors and MCPs and we were
 

763
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,389
connectors and MCPs and we were
literally in the middle of building for

764
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
literally in the middle of building for
 

765
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,870
literally in the middle of building for
our platform booked in an MCP and we

766
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
our platform booked in an MCP and we
 

767
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,389
our platform booked in an MCP and we
were experimenting with this but like

768
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
were experimenting with this but like
 

769
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,550
were experimenting with this but like
now what we were doing is just literally

770

now what we were doing is just literally
 

771
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,069
now what we were doing is just literally
being like build me a voice agent for

772
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079

928
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
actually I think it was yesterday I
 

929
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,470
actually I think it was yesterday I
released this video and I edited the

930
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
released this video and I edited the
 

931
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,790
released this video and I edited the
whole thing with Remotion. It just took

932
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
whole thing with Remotion. It just took
 

933
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,030
whole thing with Remotion. It just took
me prompting here and there. I generated

934
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
me prompting here and there. I generated
 

935
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,310
me prompting here and there. I generated
all the motion graphics and everything.

936
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
all the motion graphics and everything.
 

937
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,790
all the motion graphics and everything.
So, for your own lead genen, you can use

938
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
So, for your own lead genen, you can use
 

939
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,030
So, for your own lead genen, you can use
it to create your own videos and you can

940
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
it to create your own videos and you can
 

941
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,269
it to create your own videos and you can
use hgen like the one uh example we saw

942
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
use hgen like the one uh example we saw
 

943
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,670
use hgen like the one uh example we saw
before. But if you want to take it a

944
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
before. But if you want to take it a
 

945
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,949
before. But if you want to take it a
step further, if you're an AI agency,

946
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
step further, if you're an AI agency,
 

947
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,790
step further, if you're an AI agency,
imagine SAS companies, they probably

948
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
imagine SAS companies, they probably
 

949
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,629
imagine SAS companies, they probably
want like product videos. Imagine

950
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639

like
um videos of their product. Like ecom

956
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
um videos of their product. Like ecom
 

957
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,430
um videos of their product. Like ecom
agencies, you can use Remotion to insert

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,440
agencies, you can use Remotion to insert
 

959
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,269
agencies, you can use Remotion to insert
those assets and be like, "Hey, I just

960
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
those assets and be like, "Hey, I just

you're you set up a workspace for one of
 

985
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,590
you're you set up a workspace for one of
their clients. So, you have a folder for

986
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
their clients. So, you have a folder for
 

987
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,270
their clients. So, you have a folder for
one of their clients and in there is

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
one of their clients and in there is
 

989
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,510
one of their clients and in there is
like all of the product with their their

995
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,870
you've got the names of the products in
the folders and therefore you can like

996
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
the folders and therefore you can like
 

997
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,309

you could brainstorm within uh claude
 

1017
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,590
you could brainstorm within uh claude
code itself and maybe have like a like a

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,710
take in into account all of that
information it has there. It might be

1024
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
information it has there. It might be
 

1025
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,230
information it has there. It might be
able to pick out that particular

1026
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
able to pick out that particular
 

1027
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,909
able to pick out that particular
product, reference that in the plan and

1028
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
product, reference that in the plan and
 

1029
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,070
product, reference that in the plan and
then be able to generate a new video ad

1030

need to kind of like change your
 

1043
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,230

just add this in and get it done for

1046

just add this in and get it done for
 

1047
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,270
just add this in and get it done for
you. And it makes it a lot easier uh to

1048
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
you. And it makes it a lot easier uh to
 

1049
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,270
you. And it makes it a lot easier uh to
essentially just build these motion

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
have my UI and I put it in the same
 

1083
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,110
have my UI and I put it in the same
folder as my Remotion thing, right? So

1084
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
folder as my Remotion thing, right? So
 

1085
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,230
folder as my Remotion thing, right? So
it grabbed my assets from my UI and

1086
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
it grabbed my assets from my UI and
 

1087
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,830
it grabbed my assets from my UI and
built this this whole uh generation with

1088
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
built this this whole uh generation with
 

1089
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,789
built this this whole uh generation with
my UI components in mind. So in the same

1090
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
my UI components in mind. So in the same
 

1091
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,830
my UI components in mind. So in the same
way kind of reotion uh right here maybe

1092
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
way kind of reotion uh right here maybe
 

1093
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,270
way kind of reotion uh right here maybe
they made a better one. You just need to

1094
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,280
they made a better one. You just need to
 

1095
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,190
they made a better one. You just need to
prompt it more. But see you can have

1096
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
prompt it more. But see you can have
 

1097
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,750
prompt it more. But see you can have
those kind of swivels going up and down.

1098
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
those kind of swivels going up and down.
 

1099
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,909
those kind of swivels going up and down.
Uh I think there's more. Uh

1100
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
Uh I think there's more. Uh
 

1101
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,510
Uh I think there's more. Uh
>> well so I assume they've done all of

1102
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
>> well so I assume they've done all of
 

1103
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,390
>> well so I assume they've done all of
this.

1104
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
this.
 

1105
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,070
this.
>> Yes, they have done there's so many

1106
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
>> Yes, they have done there's so many
 

1107
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,430
>> Yes, they have done there's so many
things that are going on. There's like

1108
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
things that are going on. There's like
 

1109
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,510
things that are going on. There's like
map animations that people are making.

1110
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
map animations that people are making.
 

1111
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,750
map animations that people are making.
You're kind it kind of like the world

1112
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
You're kind it kind of like the world
 

1113
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,430
You're kind it kind of like the world
you're see this one is also made with

1114
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
you're see this one is also made with
 

1115
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,270
you're see this one is also made with
reotion if you can see this like this

1116
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
reotion if you can see this like this
 

1117
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,150
reotion if you can see this like this
map world animation this 3D yeah so it's

1118
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
map world animation this 3D yeah so it's
 

1119
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,789
map world animation this 3D yeah so it's
kind of it's your creativity oh by the

1120
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799
kind of it's your creativity oh by the
 

1121
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,549
kind of it's your creativity oh by the
way I think the thing is done uh right

1122
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
way I think the thing is done uh right
 

1123
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,110
way I think the thing is done uh right
here

1124
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120
here
 

1125
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,390
here
>> let's have a look

1126
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
>> let's have a look
 

1127
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,150
>> let's have a look
uh I guess I just skipped ahead

1128
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
uh I guess I just skipped ahead
 

1129
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,029
uh I guess I just skipped ahead
and so I could get provide information

1130
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
and so I could get provide information
 

1131
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,430
and so I could get provide information
on which 11 Labs voice to use here so

1132
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
on which 11 Labs voice to use here so
 

1133
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,750
on which 11 Labs voice to use here so
I've got my own voice it can generate

1134
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
I've got my own voice it can generate
 

1135
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,750
I've got my own voice it can generate
and what about generating

1136
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
and what about generating
 

1137
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,549
and what about generating
images and and extra footage on the fly.

1138
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
images and and extra footage on the fly.
 

1139
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,310
images and and extra footage on the fly.
Scale to 1 billion a month. There we go.

1140
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
Scale to 1 billion a month. There we go.
 

1141
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,830
Scale to 1 billion a month. There we go.
Great. [laughter]

1142
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,840
Great. [laughter]
 

1143
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,990
Great. [laughter]
And so you can just add in logos into

1144
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
And so you can just add in logos into
 

1145
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,270
And so you can just add in logos into
the assets file there and it'll be able

1146
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
the assets file there and it'll be able
 

1147
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,430
the assets file there and it'll be able
to start inserting those there as well.

1148
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,440
to start inserting those there as well.
 

1149
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,990
to start inserting those there as well.
>> Exactly. Yeah. Anything you want like

1150
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
>> Exactly. Yeah. Anything you want like
 

1151
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,510
>> Exactly. Yeah. Anything you want like
like I don't know if you saw in the

1152
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
like I don't know if you saw in the
 

1153
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,750
like I don't know if you saw in the
other one, it literally used your face.

1154
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
other one, it literally used your face.
 

1155
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,630
other one, it literally used your face.
So, so the more the more I can stack

1156
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
So, so the more the more I can stack
 

1157
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,070
So, so the more the more I can stack
into this project file, whether it's

1158
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
into this project file, whether it's
 

1159
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,310
into this project file, whether it's
like photos of my team, photos of me,

1160
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
like photos of my team, photos of me,
 

1161
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,470
like photos of my team, photos of me,
photos of like successful people, a bit

1162
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
photos of like successful people, a bit
 

1163
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,950
photos of like successful people, a bit
of like success stories and information

1164
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
of like success stories and information
 

1165
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,110
of like success stories and information
about each success story, like the more

1166
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
about each success story, like the more
 

1167
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,710
about each success story, like the more
stuff I can just jam into all those

1168
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
stuff I can just jam into all those
 

1169
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,350
stuff I can just jam into all those
folders, the more freedom it has to like

1170
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
folders, the more freedom it has to like
 

1171
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,110
folders, the more freedom it has to like
be creative with those and make better

1172
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
be creative with those and make better
 

1173
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,430
be creative with those and make better
looking visuals. Yeah, I I will still

1174
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
looking visuals. Yeah, I I will still
 

1175
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,909
looking visuals. Yeah, I I will still
say the creative shouldn't be the AI,

1176
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
say the creative shouldn't be the AI,
 

1177
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,430
say the creative shouldn't be the AI,
the creative should be you. So, um, have

1178
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
the creative should be you. So, um, have
 

1179
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,909
the creative should be you. So, um, have
you seen that Rick R, uh, what was it?

1180
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
you seen that Rick R, uh, what was it?
 

1181
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,630
you seen that Rick R, uh, what was it?
Rick Rubin, his, um, clip where he's

1182
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
Rick Rubin, his, um, clip where he's
 

1183
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,470
Rick Rubin, his, um, clip where he's
like, "I don't know how to play a music.

1184
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
like, "I don't know how to play a music.
 

1185
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,669
like, "I don't know how to play a music.
Uh, I don't know how to play the

1186
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
Uh, I don't know how to play the
 

1187
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,470
Uh, I don't know how to play the
instrument."

1188
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
instrument."
 

1189
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,549
instrument."
>> Yeah. But he just knows taste and that's

1190
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
>> Yeah. But he just knows taste and that's
 

1191
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,990
>> Yeah. But he just knows taste and that's
all you need to be.

1192
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,000
all you need to be.
 

1193
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,110
all you need to be.
>> Yep. Love it. Sweet, bro. Uh, what was

1194
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
>> Yep. Love it. Sweet, bro. Uh, what was
 

1195
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,230
>> Yep. Love it. Sweet, bro. Uh, what was
the other I think you have a few more

1196
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
the other I think you have a few more
 

1197
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,950
the other I think you have a few more
things on the board.

1198
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
things on the board.
 

1199
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,470
things on the board.
>> Yeah. So, I want to make sure like uh

1200
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
>> Yeah. So, I want to make sure like uh
 

1201
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,710
>> Yeah. So, I want to make sure like uh
you saw like one of the easier things

1202
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
you saw like one of the easier things
 

1203
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,630
you saw like one of the easier things
you can do with we were just making like

1204
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
you can do with we were just making like
 

1205
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,789
you can do with we were just making like
really fun, you know, just product demos

1206
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
really fun, you know, just product demos
 

1207
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,350
really fun, you know, just product demos
or videos right now. But you can also

1208
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
or videos right now. But you can also
 

1209
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,390
or videos right now. But you can also
stack skills, right? And what stacking

1210
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
stack skills, right? And what stacking
 

1211
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,870
stack skills, right? And what stacking
skills is, so for example, uh if you saw

1212
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
skills is, so for example, uh if you saw
 

1213
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,549
skills is, so for example, uh if you saw
in this video right here, this is all

1214
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
in this video right here, this is all
 

1215
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,950
in this video right here, this is all
realistic images. This is not the type

1216
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
realistic images. This is not the type
 

1217
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,310
realistic images. This is not the type
of product demo that we were making. And

1218
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
of product demo that we were making. And
 

1219
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,590
of product demo that we were making. And
how this this one is done is by

1220
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
how this this one is done is by
 

1221
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,750
how this this one is done is by
essentially making a bunch of let's say

1222
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
essentially making a bunch of let's say
 

1223
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,470
essentially making a bunch of let's say
Sora 2 or V3 videos and then stitching

1224
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
Sora 2 or V3 videos and then stitching
 

1225
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,470
Sora 2 or V3 videos and then stitching
them together. So when you're thinking

1226
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
them together. So when you're thinking
 

1227
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,310
them together. So when you're thinking
of Remotions, just make a folder. Let's

1228
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
of Remotions, just make a folder. Let's
 

1229
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,590
of Remotions, just make a folder. Let's
say you have a bunch of clips. Just be

1230
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
say you have a bunch of clips. Just be
 

1231
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,950
say you have a bunch of clips. Just be
like, "Hey, dump it in and be like,

1232

like, "Hey, dump it in and be like,
 

1233
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,789

00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
together, put some music on it, and
 

1237
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,270
together, put some music on it, and
it'll get that done."

1238
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
it'll get that done."
 

1239
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,350
it'll get that done."
>> Well, okay. But what if I was wanting to

1240
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
>> Well, okay. But what if I was wanting to
 

1241
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,029
>> Well, okay. But what if I was wanting to
do more of the workflow there and I I

1242
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
do more of the workflow there and I I
 

1243
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,110
do more of the workflow there and I I
have say I'm working from a brief and

1244
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
have say I'm working from a brief and
 

1245
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,590
have say I'm working from a brief and
it's like I need to make a a

1246
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
it's like I need to make a a
 

1247
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,470
it's like I need to make a a
interstellar themed uh sequence that's

1248
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
interstellar themed uh sequence that's
 

1249
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,390
interstellar themed uh sequence that's
going to sort of dramatically promote X

1250
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
going to sort of dramatically promote X
 

1251
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,669
going to sort of dramatically promote X
product. Can it help me to I guess using

1252
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
product. Can it help me to I guess using
 

1253
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,029
product. Can it help me to I guess using
just the general like writing ability of

1254
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
just the general like writing ability of
 

1255
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,870
just the general like writing ability of
claw code and and the the clawed models

1256
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
claw code and and the the clawed models
 

1257
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,270
claw code and and the the clawed models
to plan that out into a plan and then be

1258
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
to plan that out into a plan and then be
 

1259
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,710
to plan that out into a plan and then be
able to take those prompts and pass it

1260
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
able to take those prompts and pass it
 

1261
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,390
able to take those prompts and pass it
into a video generator and then I get

1262
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
into a video generator and then I get
 

1263
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,310
into a video generator and then I get
those files back within the within the

1264
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
those files back within the within the
 

1265
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,230
those files back within the within the
workspace. Right now what you can do is

1266
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
workspace. Right now what you can do is
 

1267
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,470
workspace. Right now what you can do is
like let's say you want a product demo

1268
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
like let's say you want a product demo
 

1269
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,350
like let's say you want a product demo
that's in the interstellar theme. What

1270
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
that's in the interstellar theme. What
 

1271
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,190
that's in the interstellar theme. What
you can do is give it the assets and

1272
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
you can do is give it the assets and
 

1273
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,430
you can do is give it the assets and
it'll basically layer it on top. So

1274
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
it'll basically layer it on top. So
 

1275
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,510
it'll basically layer it on top. So
it'll generate the nanobanana pro images

1276
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
it'll generate the nanobanana pro images
 

1277
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,029
it'll generate the nanobanana pro images
and you know that can basically create

1278
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
and you know that can basically create
 

1279
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,830
and you know that can basically create
anything right. So you create those and

1280
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
anything right. So you create those and
 

1281
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,510
anything right. So you create those and
then you take those and then make uh

1282
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
then you take those and then make uh
 

1283
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,510
then you take those and then make uh
videos out of that. So for example, you

1284
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
videos out of that. So for example, you
 

1285
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,070
videos out of that. So for example, you
can take nanobanana pictures and then

1286
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
can take nanobanana pictures and then
 

1287
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,430
can take nanobanana pictures and then
put it into an AI image video model like

1288
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
put it into an AI image video model like
 

1289
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,149
put it into an AI image video model like
V3 or cling and it makes that video and

1290
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
V3 or cling and it makes that video and
 

1291
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,549
V3 or cling and it makes that video and
then it stitches it together in reotion.

1292
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
then it stitches it together in reotion.
 

1293
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,310
then it stitches it together in reotion.
So what I'm trying to say is like you

1294
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,320
So what I'm trying to say is like you
 

1295
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,789
So what I'm trying to say is like you
see right here there's some like assets

1296
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
see right here there's some like assets
 

1297
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,110
see right here there's some like assets
like scenes.

1298
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
like scenes.
 

1299
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,990
like scenes.
It would take the AI video and let's say

1300
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
It would take the AI video and let's say
 

1301
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,909
It would take the AI video and let's say
place it here and it can even layer this

1302
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:41,919
place it here and it can even layer this
 

1303
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,390
place it here and it can even layer this
stuff on top like these little things.

1304
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
stuff on top like these little things.
 

1305
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,710
stuff on top like these little things.
>> Cir. And you can just prompt your way to

1306
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
>> Cir. And you can just prompt your way to
 

1307
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,310
>> Cir. And you can just prompt your way to
whatever the whatever motion graphics

1308
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
whatever the whatever motion graphics
 

1309
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,149
whatever the whatever motion graphics
you want over your over your A-roll.

1310
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:50,159
you want over your over your A-roll.
 

1311
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,149
you want over your over your A-roll.
>> Exactly. Yeah. You can you can use any

1312
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
>> Exactly. Yeah. You can you can use any
 

1313
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,870
>> Exactly. Yeah. You can you can use any
A-roll, any assets you need. It's just,

1314
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
A-roll, any assets you need. It's just,
 

1315
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,390
A-roll, any assets you need. It's just,
you know, getting the taste and the

1316
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
you know, getting the taste and the
 

1317
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,230
you know, getting the taste and the
creativity out from yourself. It's

1318
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
creativity out from yourself. It's
 

1319
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,470
creativity out from yourself. It's
basically just a video editor that you

1320
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
basically just a video editor that you
 

1321
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,390
basically just a video editor that you
can prompt. That's that's all Remotion

1322
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
can prompt. That's that's all Remotion
 

1323
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,390
can prompt. That's that's all Remotion
is. But the nice part is that, you know,

1324
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
is. But the nice part is that, you know,
 

1325
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,470
is. But the nice part is that, you know,
you can also just like with cloud code

1326
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
you can also just like with cloud code
 

1327
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,310
you can also just like with cloud code
point it at your assets as well. So you

1328
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
point it at your assets as well. So you
 

1329
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,230
point it at your assets as well. So you
can make branded everything in your own

1330
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
can make branded everything in your own
 

1331
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,990
can make branded everything in your own
theme. So the thing you mentioned with

1332
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
theme. So the thing you mentioned with
 

1333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,390
theme. So the thing you mentioned with
the marketing brief, if you had that,

1334
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
the marketing brief, if you had that,
 

1335
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,990
the marketing brief, if you had that,
what you would have to do is put it

1336
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
what you would have to do is put it
 

1337
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,350
what you would have to do is put it
inside the claw.md and the claw.md would

1338
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
inside the claw.md and the claw.md would
 

1339
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,350
inside the claw.md and the claw.md would
make it consistent and always use that

1340
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
make it consistent and always use that
 

1341
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,190
make it consistent and always use that
style or what you're trying to do.

1342
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
style or what you're trying to do.
 

1343
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,710
style or what you're trying to do.
>> Okay. So for someone who's looking to to

1344
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
>> Okay. So for someone who's looking to to
 

1345
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,590
>> Okay. So for someone who's looking to to
get started with this probably for I

don't know their own content creation.

1348
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960
don't know their own content creation.
 

1349
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,990
don't know their own content creation.
Maybe they're trying to make some

1350
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
Maybe they're trying to make some
 

1351
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,270
Maybe they're trying to make some
YouTube videos or maybe they're trying

1352
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,280
YouTube videos or maybe they're trying
 

1353
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,669
YouTube videos or maybe they're trying
to market their own their own product

1354
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
to market their own their own product
 

1355
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,510
to market their own their own product
and they want to make sort of a a demo

1356
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
and they want to make sort of a a demo
 

1357
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,830
and they want to make sort of a a demo
video for it or something. So it's just

1358
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
video for it or something. So it's just
 

1359
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,710
video for it or something. So it's just
getting their uh clawed workspace set up

1360
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
getting their uh clawed workspace set up

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,909
getting their uh clawed workspace set up
basically whatever you are. Do you

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,990
basically whatever you are. Do you
recommend using the the uh desktop

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
recommend using the the uh desktop
 

1365
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,669
recommend using the the uh desktop
application or is it actually better to

1366
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
application or is it actually better to
 

1367
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,270
application or is it actually better to
just use it directly in like in VS Code

1368
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,280
just use it directly in like in VS Code
 

1369
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,190
just use it directly in like in VS Code
with a uh claw code in the terminal?

1370
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
with a uh claw code in the terminal?
 

1371
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,190

100% just go to cloud desktop and then

1376

100% just go to cloud desktop and then
just use the the code from here because

claude. But if you're a bit more
 

1383
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,510
claude. But if you're a bit more
advanced, then if you do use VS Code,

1384
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
advanced, then if you do use VS Code,
 

1385
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,190
advanced, then if you do use VS Code,
you can just see all the assets on the

1386
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
you can just see all the assets on the
 

1387
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,190
you can just see all the assets on the
side and it's a lot easier to manage,

1388
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
side and it's a lot easier to manage,
 

1389
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,350
side and it's a lot easier to manage,
right? It's just, you know, baby steps

1390
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
right? It's just, you know, baby steps
 

1391
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,190
right? It's just, you know, baby steps
into getting into it. So if you're brand

1392
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,200
into getting into it. So if you're brand
 

1393
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,269
into getting into it. So if you're brand
new, just use Cloud Desktop. If you're a

1394
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
new, just use Cloud Desktop. If you're a
 

1395
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,710
new, just use Cloud Desktop. If you're a
bit more advanced and you know how VS

1396
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
bit more advanced and you know how VS
 

1397
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,190
bit more advanced and you know how VS
Code works, maybe use cloud code through

1398
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
Code works, maybe use cloud code through
 

1399
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,630
Code works, maybe use cloud code through
that. That's awesome. Thank you so much

1400
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
that. That's awesome. Thank you so much

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
have a play around with this and get my
 

1405
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,510
have a play around with this and get my
my edit team working on it cuz um

1406
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
my edit team working on it cuz um
 

1407
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,470
my edit team working on it cuz um
they've been waiting for something like

1411
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,950
this for a while. But it's incredible
this like claude code explosion we're

1412
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
this like claude code explosion we're
 

1413
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,029
this like claude code explosion we're
seeing. Um, and it's it's kind of scary

1414
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,039
seeing. Um, and it's it's kind of scary

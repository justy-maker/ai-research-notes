00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:01,839
All right, guys. So, with the Claudebot

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,590
All right, guys. So, with the Claudebot
dusts finally starting to settle and a

4
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600
dusts finally starting to settle and a
 

5
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,349
dusts finally starting to settle and a
bit of clarity uh coming around what

6
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
bit of clarity uh coming around what
 

7
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,630
bit of clarity uh coming around what
this thing is and what the potential of

8
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,640
this thing is and what the potential of
 

9
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,150
this thing is and what the potential of
it is, I've had time to play around with

10
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
it is, I've had time to play around with
 

11
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,669
it is, I've had time to play around with
it myself. I've seen what other people

12
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
it myself. I've seen what other people
 

13
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,110
it myself. I've seen what other people
are doing with it. So, I thought I'd

14
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
are doing with it. So, I thought I'd
 

15
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,470
are doing with it. So, I thought I'd
come on here and try to give a bit of

16
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
come on here and try to give a bit of
 

17
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,789
come on here and try to give a bit of
clarity about what I see like where this

18
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
clarity about what I see like where this
 

19
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,550
clarity about what I see like where this
is going in my opinion, what I'm doing

20
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
is going in my opinion, what I'm doing
 

21
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,230
is going in my opinion, what I'm doing
at my agency morning side to kind of

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
at my agency morning side to kind of
 

23
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,870
at my agency morning side to kind of
adjust for this and what the long-term

24
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
adjust for this and what the long-term
 

25
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,349
adjust for this and what the long-term
ramifications are for this um within the

00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
ramifications are for this um within the
 

27
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,269
ramifications are for this um within the
wider AI and tech ecosystem. If you're

I've built up over the past few years of
what these new and exciting trends

00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
what these new and exciting trends
 

55
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,150
what these new and exciting trends
popping up all the time mean and how to

popping up all the time mean and how to
 

57
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,510
popping up all the time mean and how to
adjust them basically without losing

adjust them basically without losing
 

59
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,790
adjust them basically without losing
your head. The biggest question around

60
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
your head. The biggest question around
 

61
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,270
your head. The biggest question around
clawbot open claw right now is is this

62
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
clawbot open claw right now is is this
 

63
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,590
clawbot open claw right now is is this
noise or is this actual signal? Is this

64
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
noise or is this actual signal? Is this
 

65
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,110
noise or is this actual signal? Is this
where the market is heading? Is there

66
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
where the market is heading? Is there
 

67
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,310
where the market is heading? Is there
something bigger here that we need to

68
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
something bigger here that we need to
 

69
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,670
something bigger here that we need to
pay attention to? And if it is signal

70
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
pay attention to? And if it is signal
 

71
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,630
pay attention to? And if it is signal
then what are we supposed to do about

72
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
then what are we supposed to do about
 

73
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,470
then what are we supposed to do about
it? The way I see it is that this is a

74
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
it? The way I see it is that this is a
 

75
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,070
it? The way I see it is that this is a
big deal. Like this is definitely

76
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
big deal. Like this is definitely
 

77
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,429
big deal. Like this is definitely
signal. This is something we need to be

78
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
signal. This is something we need to be
 

79
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,270
signal. This is something we need to be
paying attention to because you don't

80
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
paying attention to because you don't
 

81
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,429
paying attention to because you don't
see things just explode like that for no

82
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
see things just explode like that for no
 

83
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,109
see things just explode like that for no
reason, right? This is a a clear signal

84
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
reason, right? This is a a clear signal
 

85
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,310
reason, right? This is a a clear signal
that the market wants something like

86
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
that the market wants something like
 

87
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,230
that the market wants something like
this. The question is, is it super

88
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
this. The question is, is it super
 

89
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,070
this. The question is, is it super
relevant to us as AI business owners? Is

90
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
relevant to us as AI business owners? Is
 

91
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,190
relevant to us as AI business owners? Is
this something that we should allow to

92
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
this something that we should allow to
 

93
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,190
this something that we should allow to
occupy a bunch of our brain space and

94
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
occupy a bunch of our brain space and
 

95
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,710
occupy a bunch of our brain space and
sort of tear us away from what we've

96
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
sort of tear us away from what we've
 

97
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,990
sort of tear us away from what we've
been doing for so long? If you've been

98
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
been doing for so long? If you've been
 

99
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,230
been doing for so long? If you've been
running an agency or AI business for a

100
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
running an agency or AI business for a
 

101
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,830
running an agency or AI business for a
year or two now, is this something that

102
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
year or two now, is this something that
 

103
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,270
year or two now, is this something that
you really need to give a lot of thought

104
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
you really need to give a lot of thought
 

105
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,870
you really need to give a lot of thought
to? And I hope I can give some kind of

106
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
to? And I hope I can give some kind of
 

107
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,830
to? And I hope I can give some kind of
clarity around that. The most

108
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
clarity around that. The most
 

109
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,749
clarity around that. The most
significant part about Claude Hub, Open

110
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
significant part about Claude Hub, Open

Claw, or whatever the freak we're

112
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
Claw, or whatever the freak we're
 

113
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,550
Claw, or whatever the freak we're
calling it these days, is its potential

114
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
calling it these days, is its potential
 

115
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,069
calling it these days, is its potential
to be like the iPhone moment for AI. And

116
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
to be like the iPhone moment for AI. And
 

117
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,390
to be like the iPhone moment for AI. And
I mean that by it's a new platform that

118
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
I mean that by it's a new platform that
 

119
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,230
I mean that by it's a new platform that
you can build on top of just like you

120
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
you can build on top of just like you
 

121
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,429
you can build on top of just like you
had the iPhone, then you had the app

122
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
had the iPhone, then you had the app
 

123
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,870
had the iPhone, then you had the app
store. How many times have we heard like

124
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
store. How many times have we heard like
 

125
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,469
store. How many times have we heard like
this is the app store moment for AI? But

126
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
this is the app store moment for AI? But
 

127
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,710
this is the app store moment for AI? But
I think this actually is is up there.

128
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
I think this actually is is up there.
 

129
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,069
I think this actually is is up there.
It's like the strongest contender that

130
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
It's like the strongest contender that
 

131
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,429
It's like the strongest contender that
I've ever seen for this actually being

132
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
I've ever seen for this actually being
 

133
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,749
I've ever seen for this actually being
an app store moment. We have OpenClaw or

134
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
an app store moment. We have OpenClaw or
 

135
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,830
an app store moment. We have OpenClaw or
whatever the like name you want to use

136
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
whatever the like name you want to use
 

137
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,830
whatever the like name you want to use
for it, the actual platform that is on

138
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
for it, the actual platform that is on
 

139
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,270
for it, the actual platform that is on
the device or the Mac Mini, whatever

140
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
the device or the Mac Mini, whatever
 

141
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,510
the device or the Mac Mini, whatever
you're using it on. That is the platform

142
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
you're using it on. That is the platform
 

143
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,030
you're using it on. That is the platform
and then we have Claude Hub which is the

144
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
and then we have Claude Hub which is the
 

145
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,310
and then we have Claude Hub which is the
marketplace released by the founder

146
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
marketplace released by the founder
 

147
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,670
marketplace released by the founder
where you have these skills which you

148
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
where you have these skills which you
 

149
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,670
where you have these skills which you
can easily pull in and install and

150
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
can easily pull in and install and
 

151
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,669
can easily pull in and install and
expand the functionality of your

152
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
expand the functionality of your
 

153
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,190
expand the functionality of your
personal assistant of your agent. Now,

154
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
personal assistant of your agent. Now,
 

155
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,710
personal assistant of your agent. Now,
this is actually a huge deal and I think

156
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
this is actually a huge deal and I think
 

157
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,110
this is actually a huge deal and I think
skills in general are probably the most

158
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
skills in general are probably the most
 

159
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,229
skills in general are probably the most
important thing that you need to be

160
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
important thing that you need to be
 

161
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,150
important thing that you need to be
aware of right now as an agency owner or

162
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
aware of right now as an agency owner or
 

163
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,790
aware of right now as an agency owner or
anyone in AI because skills the way that

164
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
anyone in AI because skills the way that
 

165
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,550
anyone in AI because skills the way that
they're set up and that that these like

166
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
they're set up and that that these like
 

167
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,070
they're set up and that that these like
text documents or a couple different

168
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
text documents or a couple different
 

169
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,990
text documents or a couple different
folders and more context or ways to call

170
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
folders and more context or ways to call
 

171
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,390
folders and more context or ways to call
certain scripts. This is the the new

172
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
certain scripts. This is the the new
 

173
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,070
certain scripts. This is the the new
SAS. This is bundling of some sort of

SAS. This is bundling of some sort of
 

175
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,589
SAS. This is bundling of some sort of
functionality and how you can explain it

176
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
functionality and how you can explain it
 

177
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,110

this skill I'm going to look in and
 

205
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,790
this skill I'm going to look in and
actually load all the context now so

206
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
actually load all the context now so
 

207
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,309
actually load all the context now so
it's a much smarter way of using context

208
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
it's a much smarter way of using context
 

209
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,949
it's a much smarter way of using context
than MCP was but what skills really

210
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
than MCP was but what skills really

offer is a new route into SAS and I

212
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
offer is a new route into SAS and I
 

213
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,949
offer is a new route into SAS and I
think if you look at this as a new

214
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
think if you look at this as a new
 

215
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,869
think if you look at this as a new
platform and cla being the marketplace

216
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
platform and cla being the marketplace
 

217
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,630
platform and cla being the marketplace
with the app store you're going to have

218
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
with the app store you're going to have
 

219
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,030
with the app store you're going to have
the opportunity to be able to build

220
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
the opportunity to be able to build
 

221
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,110
the opportunity to be able to build
essentially a SAS in a skill and skills

222
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
essentially a SAS in a skill and skills
 

223
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,270
essentially a SAS in a skill and skills
become SAS in a certain way. So there's

224
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
become SAS in a certain way. So there's
 

225
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,949
become SAS in a certain way. So there's
a bunch of different angles you could go

226
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
a bunch of different angles you could go
 

227
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,869
a bunch of different angles you could go
with it, but essentially the barrier to

228
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
with it, but essentially the barrier to
 

229
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,550
with it, but essentially the barrier to
entry for SAS is going to drop massively

230
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
entry for SAS is going to drop massively
 

231
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,030
entry for SAS is going to drop massively
because there's people who are trying to

232
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
because there's people who are trying to
 

233
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,550
because there's people who are trying to
build SAS right now. You need to have an

234
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
build SAS right now. You need to have an
 

235
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,830
build SAS right now. You need to have an
interface and you need to build your

236
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
interface and you need to build your
 

237
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,430
interface and you need to build your
backend functionality and you have to

238
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
backend functionality and you have to
 

239
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,630
backend functionality and you have to
host it on this thing and like go

240
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
host it on this thing and like go
 

241
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,110
host it on this thing and like go
through all the UIUX design. And if

242
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
through all the UIUX design. And if
 

243
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,190
through all the UIUX design. And if
you're looking at this through QuadBot,

244
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
you're looking at this through QuadBot,
 

245
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,270
you're looking at this through QuadBot,
you can just have a signup page. You can

246
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
you can just have a signup page. You can
 

247
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,110
you can just have a signup page. You can
say, "Hey, this is a great example I

248
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
say, "Hey, this is a great example I
 

249
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,430
say, "Hey, this is a great example I
think is a a skill that would be a

250
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
think is a a skill that would be a
 

251
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,670
think is a a skill that would be a
YouTube uh video transcript generator."

252
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
YouTube uh video transcript generator."
 

253
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,750
YouTube uh video transcript generator."
So using a a proper transcription method

254
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
So using a a proper transcription method
 

255
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,070
So using a a proper transcription method
like OpenAI whisper rather than just

256
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
like OpenAI whisper rather than just
 

257
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,509
like OpenAI whisper rather than just
sort of stripping it off the captions

258
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
sort of stripping it off the captions
 

259
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,949
sort of stripping it off the captions
which is usually quite garbage. A lot of

260
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
which is usually quite garbage. A lot of
 

261
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,710
which is usually quite garbage. A lot of
people are going to need that utility of

262
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
people are going to need that utility of
 

263
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,390
people are going to need that utility of
being able to hey can you please get the

264
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
being able to hey can you please get the
 

265
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,070
being able to hey can you please get the
transcript from this YouTube video but I

266
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
transcript from this YouTube video but I
 

267
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,350
transcript from this YouTube video but I
want a high quality transcription

268
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
want a high quality transcription
 

269
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,509
want a high quality transcription
because I want my resulting content to

270
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
because I want my resulting content to
 

271
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,270
because I want my resulting content to
be good like garbage in garbage out. And

272
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
be good like garbage in garbage out. And
 

273
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,910
be good like garbage in garbage out. And
so say I go and vibe code up a YouTube

274
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
so say I go and vibe code up a YouTube
 

275
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,910
so say I go and vibe code up a YouTube
transcription as a service tool. I put a

276
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
transcription as a service tool. I put a
 

277
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,350
transcription as a service tool. I put a
little landing page up and I say hey

278
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
little landing page up and I say hey
 

279
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,670
little landing page up and I say hey
sign up here. They pay $9 a month and

280
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
sign up here. They pay $9 a month and
 

281
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,190
sign up here. They pay $9 a month and
then I give them their API key. then

282
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
then I give them their API key. then
 

283
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,190
then I give them their API key. then
they can integrate the skill and the API

284
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
they can integrate the skill and the API
 

285
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,030
they can integrate the skill and the API
key into the claude bot. Now they have

286
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
key into the claude bot. Now they have
 

287
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,229
key into the claude bot. Now they have
access to this high quality

288
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
access to this high quality
 

289
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,069
access to this high quality
transcription service. I didn't have to

290
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
transcription service. I didn't have to
 

291
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,909
transcription service. I didn't have to
build out some fancy well it's probably

292
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
build out some fancy well it's probably
 

293
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,069
build out some fancy well it's probably
not the best example for a UI uh needing

294
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
not the best example for a UI uh needing
 

295
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,069
not the best example for a UI uh needing
UI being a transcription service but you

296
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
UI being a transcription service but you
 

297
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,830
UI being a transcription service but you
get what I mean in that now you just

298
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
get what I mean in that now you just
 

299
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,749
get what I mean in that now you just
need to build some valuable backend

300
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
need to build some valuable backend
 

301
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,110
need to build some valuable backend
functionality people would want to hook

302
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
functionality people would want to hook
 

303
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,390
functionality people would want to hook
into their agent. And so we're about to

304
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
into their agent. And so we're about to
 

305
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,990
into their agent. And so we're about to
see an explosion of these tools because

306
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
see an explosion of these tools because
 

307
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,270
see an explosion of these tools because
people can now just vibe code some

308
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
people can now just vibe code some
 

309
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,629
people can now just vibe code some
backend functionality, put up a basic

310
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
backend functionality, put up a basic
 

311
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,990
backend functionality, put up a basic
landing page, set up a Stripe

312
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
landing page, set up a Stripe
 

313
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,310
landing page, set up a Stripe
integration, list it on Clawhub for some

314
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
integration, list it on Clawhub for some
 

315
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,070
integration, list it on Clawhub for some
traffic and to get visibility for the

316
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
traffic and to get visibility for the
 

317
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,150
traffic and to get visibility for the
application and if they can get a couple

318
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
application and if they can get a couple
 

319
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,430
application and if they can get a couple
up votes, you're going to get natural

320
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
up votes, you're going to get natural
 

321
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,749
up votes, you're going to get natural
distribution. So there is an opportunity

322
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
distribution. So there is an opportunity
 

323
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,270
distribution. So there is an opportunity
there and I think keeping in mind that

324
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
there and I think keeping in mind that
 

325
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,350
there and I think keeping in mind that
there's sort of skills and SAS and what

326
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
there's sort of skills and SAS and what
 

327
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,590
there's sort of skills and SAS and what
this means for these personal assistants

328
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
this means for these personal assistants
 

329
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,189
this means for these personal assistants
where that goes on the business side if

330
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
where that goes on the business side if
 

331
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,310
where that goes on the business side if
these are going to be I mean just

332
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
these are going to be I mean just
 

333
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,990
these are going to be I mean just
because of the security issues I think

334
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
because of the security issues I think
 

335
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,110
because of the security issues I think
it's safe to say that there's a very

336
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
it's safe to say that there's a very
 

337
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,550
it's safe to say that there's a very
clear line between this being a fun

338
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
clear line between this being a fun
 

339
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,230
clear line between this being a fun
consumer tool and this being something

340
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
consumer tool and this being something
 

341
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,510
consumer tool and this being something
that businesses are going to look at. So

342
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
that businesses are going to look at. So
 

343
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,469
that businesses are going to look at. So
there's a considerable amount of

344
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
there's a considerable amount of
 

345
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,510
there's a considerable amount of
development work and security

346
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
development work and security
 

347
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,790
development work and security
infrastructure that needs to be put in

348
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
infrastructure that needs to be put in
 

349
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,710
infrastructure that needs to be put in
before this is even thinkable as a

350
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
before this is even thinkable as a
 

351
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,390
before this is even thinkable as a
business tool. uh purely if you're in

352
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
business tool. uh purely if you're in
 

353
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,590
business tool. uh purely if you're in
this game to make money, you're trying

354
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
this game to make money, you're trying
 

355
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,430
this game to make money, you're trying
to build an AI business, you want to tap

356
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
to build an AI business, you want to tap
 

357
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,870
to build an AI business, you want to tap
into this opportunity and make some

358
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
into this opportunity and make some
 

359
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,710
into this opportunity and make some
money, this kind of skills as SAS thing

360
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
money, this kind of skills as SAS thing
 

361
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,550
money, this kind of skills as SAS thing
is where I'd say the the opportunity is

362
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
is where I'd say the the opportunity is
 

363
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,790
is where I'd say the the opportunity is
right now. Now, the question is, should

364
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
right now. Now, the question is, should
 

365
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,950
right now. Now, the question is, should
you take action on it? Should you give

366
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
you take action on it? Should you give
 

367
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,469
you take action on it? Should you give
up the the thing you've been working on

368
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
up the the thing you've been working on
 

369
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,990
up the the thing you've been working on
for so long to go and chase the shiny

370
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
for so long to go and chase the shiny
 

371
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,870
for so long to go and chase the shiny
new object? The best way I could sort of

372
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
new object? The best way I could sort of
 

373
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,270
new object? The best way I could sort of
analogy for this would be building your

374
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
analogy for this would be building your
 

375
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,710
analogy for this would be building your
house upon the sand or building your

376
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
house upon the sand or building your
 

377
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,469
house upon the sand or building your
house upon the rock. You know, the the

378
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
house upon the rock. You know, the the
 

379
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,749
house upon the rock. You know, the the
parable, the wise man built his house

380
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
parable, the wise man built his house
 

381
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,749
parable, the wise man built his house
upon the on the rock and the foolish man

382
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
upon the on the rock and the foolish man
 

383
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,029
upon the on the rock and the foolish man
built his house upon the sand. There is

384
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
built his house upon the sand. There is
 

385
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,629
built his house upon the sand. There is
always going to be new stuff coming out

386
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
always going to be new stuff coming out
 

387
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,469
always going to be new stuff coming out
in the AI space. This is just the

388
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
in the AI space. This is just the
 

389
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,310
in the AI space. This is just the
latest. Like we have these surges every

390
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
latest. Like we have these surges every
 

391
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,150
latest. Like we have these surges every
3 to 6 months. There's a new thing that

392
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
3 to 6 months. There's a new thing that
 

393
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,590
3 to 6 months. There's a new thing that
comes out. Maybe it's a nana banana

394
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
comes out. Maybe it's a nana banana
 

395
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,629
comes out. Maybe it's a nana banana
model that comes out and it's way

396
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
model that comes out and it's way
 

397
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,070
model that comes out and it's way
better. And suddenly there's a a big

398
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
better. And suddenly there's a a big
 

399
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,670
better. And suddenly there's a a big
burst in and interest over there cuz

400
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
burst in and interest over there cuz
 

401
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,350
burst in and interest over there cuz
there are new opportunities that you

402
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
there are new opportunities that you
 

403
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,110
there are new opportunities that you
know like I talk about there's fertile

404
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
know like I talk about there's fertile
 

405
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,790
know like I talk about there's fertile
planes. When you have step changes in

406
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
planes. When you have step changes in
 

407
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,469
planes. When you have step changes in
the capability of a technology, suddenly

408
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
the capability of a technology, suddenly
 

409
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,150
the capability of a technology, suddenly
there's this fertile plane where there's

410
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
there's this fertile plane where there's
 

411
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,430
there's this fertile plane where there's
all these businesses that are waiting to

412
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
all these businesses that are waiting to
 

413
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,029
all these businesses that are waiting to
be created. And there's absolutely a

414
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
be created. And there's absolutely a
 

415
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,629
be created. And there's absolutely a
fertile plane that's popped up here. The

416
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
fertile plane that's popped up here. The
 

417
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,510
fertile plane that's popped up here. The
question is, is that fertile plane

418
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
question is, is that fertile plane
 

419
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,710
question is, is that fertile plane
better than the one that we're currently

420
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
better than the one that we're currently
 

421
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,390
better than the one that we're currently
on? If you're running an AI agency and

422
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
on? If you're running an AI agency and
 

423
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,749
on? If you're running an AI agency and
if you zoom out longterm, is that

424
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
if you zoom out longterm, is that
 

425
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,710
if you zoom out longterm, is that
actually going to take you where you

426
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
actually going to take you where you
 

427
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,870
actually going to take you where you
want to go? My take on this is that

428
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
want to go? My take on this is that
 

429
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,550
want to go? My take on this is that
there's a so many problems that need to

430
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
there's a so many problems that need to
 

431
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,469
there's a so many problems that need to
be solved in the AI space. There's so

432
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
be solved in the AI space. There's so
 

433
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,309
be solved in the AI space. There's so
many opportunities like these new skills

434
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
many opportunities like these new skills
 

435
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,749
many opportunities like these new skills
of SAS, there's the building on the

436
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
of SAS, there's the building on the
 

437
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,590
of SAS, there's the building on the
clawbot platform. But the bigger

438
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
clawbot platform. But the bigger
 

439
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,950
clawbot platform. But the bigger
opportunity that is a lot more

440
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
opportunity that is a lot more
 

441
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,550
opportunity that is a lot more
unchanging and ultimately going to cause

442
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
unchanging and ultimately going to cause
 

443
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,390
unchanging and ultimately going to cause
you a lot less stress and and headache

444
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
you a lot less stress and and headache
 

445
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,749
you a lot less stress and and headache
is the the problem that we've been

446
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
is the the problem that we've been
 

447
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,270
is the the problem that we've been
solving all along which is there's tens

448
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
solving all along which is there's tens
 

449
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,950
solving all along which is there's tens
of millions of businesses out there who

450
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
of millions of businesses out there who
 

451
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,510
of millions of businesses out there who
don't understand AI. They don't know how

452
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
don't understand AI. They don't know how
 

453
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,189
don't understand AI. They don't know how
to use it. They need someone's help.

454
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
to use it. They need someone's help.
 

455
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,110
to use it. They need someone's help.
They need to identify the best use cases

456
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
They need to identify the best use cases
 

457
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,469
They need to identify the best use cases
for them and they need someone to build

458
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
for them and they need someone to build
 

459
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,070
for them and they need someone to build
it and train their teams on it. There's

460
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
it and train their teams on it. There's
 

461
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,909
it and train their teams on it. There's
all of that is still right there. And

462
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
all of that is still right there. And
 

463
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,909
all of that is still right there. And
you can take the 99% of all the software

464
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
you can take the 99% of all the software
 

465
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,230
you can take the 99% of all the software
that is out the AI innovation we've had

466
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
that is out the AI innovation we've had
 

467
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,230
that is out the AI innovation we've had
over the past 3 years and they still

468
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
over the past 3 years and they still
 

469
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,309
over the past 3 years and they still
need all that. this this little 1% of of

470
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
need all that. this this little 1% of of
 

471
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,830
need all that. this this little 1% of of
clawbot and open claw in that whole

472
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
clawbot and open claw in that whole
 

473
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,350
clawbot and open claw in that whole
ecosystem

474
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
ecosystem
 

475
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,189
ecosystem
that's that can be its own thing, right?

476
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
that's that can be its own thing, right?
 

477
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,870
that's that can be its own thing, right?
That's going to be maybe a flash in the

478
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
That's going to be maybe a flash in the
 

479
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,469
That's going to be maybe a flash in the
pan. Something that moves so quickly

480
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
pan. Something that moves so quickly
 

481
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,309
pan. Something that moves so quickly
that the vast majority of you apart from

482
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
that the vast majority of you apart from
 

483
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,629
that the vast majority of you apart from
the like most technical people or maybe

484
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
the like most technical people or maybe
 

485
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,870
the like most technical people or maybe
like the the 18-year-old who's like been

486
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
like the the 18-year-old who's like been
 

487
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,870
like the the 18-year-old who's like been
vibe coding and is really like on the

488
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
vibe coding and is really like on the
 

489
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,070
vibe coding and is really like on the
cutting edge of it. You're always on

490
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
cutting edge of it. You're always on
 

491
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,830
cutting edge of it. You're always on
Twitter. Maybe you have a chance or

492
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
Twitter. Maybe you have a chance or
 

493
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,029
Twitter. Maybe you have a chance or
maybe that would be a better move for

494
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
maybe that would be a better move for
 

495
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,950
maybe that would be a better move for
you to go into this new ecosystem and

496
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
you to go into this new ecosystem and
 

497
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,469
you to go into this new ecosystem and
really try to establish yourself. But

498
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
really try to establish yourself. But
 

499
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,909
really try to establish yourself. But
for the vast majority of people who are

500
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
for the vast majority of people who are
 

501
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,670
for the vast majority of people who are
not super technical and who can't move

502
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
not super technical and who can't move
 

503
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,390
not super technical and who can't move
at the like incredible rate of of

504
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
at the like incredible rate of of
 

505
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,830
at the like incredible rate of of
improvement that these things are going

506
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
improvement that these things are going
 

507
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,990
improvement that these things are going
at, then it's not really the the arena

508
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
at, then it's not really the the arena
 

509
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,029
at, then it's not really the the arena
to be playing in for you. You're going

510
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
to be playing in for you. You're going
 

511
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,550
to be playing in for you. You're going
to get eaten for lunch by these people

512
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
to get eaten for lunch by these people
 

513
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,870
to get eaten for lunch by these people
who are absolutely like crack when it

514
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
who are absolutely like crack when it
 

515
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,710
who are absolutely like crack when it
comes to AI engineering. They're so much

516
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
comes to AI engineering. They're so much
 

517
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,150
comes to AI engineering. They're so much
faster and better at building and

518
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
faster and better at building and
 

519
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,350
faster and better at building and
shipping than you. So, in my opinion,

520
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
shipping than you. So, in my opinion,
 

521
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,710
shipping than you. So, in my opinion,
the vast majority of you guys need to

522
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
the vast majority of you guys need to
 

523
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,469
the vast majority of you guys need to
like keep this in mind. Understand what

524
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
like keep this in mind. Understand what
 

525
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,830
like keep this in mind. Understand what
I've said here about the SAS and the

526
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
I've said here about the SAS and the
 

527
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,749
I've said here about the SAS and the
skills and how this is all moving. Keep

528
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
skills and how this is all moving. Keep
 

529
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,390
skills and how this is all moving. Keep
an eye on that. But the house that we've

530
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
an eye on that. But the house that we've
 

531
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,070
an eye on that. But the house that we've
been building for the past few years

532
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
been building for the past few years
 

533
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,830
been building for the past few years
still needs to be built. There's still

534
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
still needs to be built. There's still
 

535
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,029
still needs to be built. There's still
demand for this house we've been

536
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
demand for this house we've been
 

537
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,790
demand for this house we've been
building. The pace of AI innovation and

538
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
building. The pace of AI innovation and
 

539
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,990
building. The pace of AI innovation and
these new things coming out of the time

540
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
these new things coming out of the time
 

541
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,990
these new things coming out of the time
is only going to continue to accelerate.

542
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
is only going to continue to accelerate.
 

543
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,909
is only going to continue to accelerate.
But what is constant or what is is sort

544
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
But what is constant or what is is sort
 

545
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,189
But what is constant or what is is sort
of unchanging is the fact that we have a

546
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
of unchanging is the fact that we have a
 

547
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,589
of unchanging is the fact that we have a
human issue in AI. We have a training

548
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
human issue in AI. We have a training
 

549
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,990
human issue in AI. We have a training
issue in AI. And the where the rubber

550
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
issue in AI. And the where the rubber
 

551
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,830
issue in AI. And the where the rubber
really meets the road of hey, I've

552
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
really meets the road of hey, I've
 

553
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,110
really meets the road of hey, I've
identified some opportunities. We've

554
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
identified some opportunities. We've
 

555
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,469
identified some opportunities. We've
built it for you. Now we need to

556
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
built it for you. Now we need to
 

557
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,510
built it for you. Now we need to
actually get it to stick in the

558
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
actually get it to stick in the
 

559
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,029
actually get it to stick in the
organization and for people to use it.

560
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
organization and for people to use it.
 

561
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,189
organization and for people to use it.
That's still the issue. And like if you

562
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
That's still the issue. And like if you
 

563
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,110
That's still the issue. And like if you
want to build a sustainable and durable

564
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
want to build a sustainable and durable
 

565
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,550
want to build a sustainable and durable
business, you don't want to go and build

566
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
business, you don't want to go and build
 

567
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,309
business, you don't want to go and build
it on the sand of this new thing that

568
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
it on the sand of this new thing that
 

569
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,830
it on the sand of this new thing that
could be a flash in the pan and before

570
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
could be a flash in the pan and before
 

571
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,029
could be a flash in the pan and before
you know it like open eyes drop

572
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
you know it like open eyes drop
 

573
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,629
you know it like open eyes drop
something or applaud or whatever. Uh

574
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
something or applaud or whatever. Uh
 

575
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,070
something or applaud or whatever. Uh
which is which is bound to happen. Let's

576
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
which is which is bound to happen. Let's
 

577
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,510
which is which is bound to happen. Let's
be honest. It makes a lot more sense to

578
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
be honest. It makes a lot more sense to
 

579
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,950
be honest. It makes a lot more sense to
keep betting on what we've been working

580
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
keep betting on what we've been working
 

581
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,110
keep betting on what we've been working
on rather than this new thing. So I'd

582
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
on rather than this new thing. So I'd
 

583
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,390
on rather than this new thing. So I'd
rather work with the devil I know than

584
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
rather work with the devil I know than
 

585
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,070
rather work with the devil I know than
what I don't. So to bring this all home,

586
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
what I don't. So to bring this all home,
 

587
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,830
what I don't. So to bring this all home,
for the vast majority of you who are not

588
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
for the vast majority of you who are not
 

589
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,909
for the vast majority of you who are not
extremely technical, who are following

590
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
extremely technical, who are following
 

591
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,310
extremely technical, who are following
this like by the minute on Twitter, who

592
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
this like by the minute on Twitter, who
 

593
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,909
this like by the minute on Twitter, who
are super deep in that ecosystem

594
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
are super deep in that ecosystem
 

595
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,190
are super deep in that ecosystem
already, if you already have been

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
still. how to actually deliver your
 

617
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,790
still. how to actually deliver your
development services, how to train the

development services, how to train the
 

619
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,870
development services, how to train the
teams on it. These are going to be

620
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
teams on it. These are going to be
 

621
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,470
teams on it. These are going to be

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
more valuable than, oh, I made a new
 

651

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
little skill or SAS skill on Hub and I
 

653
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,550
little skill or SAS skill on Hub and I
got like 5,000 stars and I made like

654
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
got like 5,000 stars and I made like
 

655
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,389
got like 5,000 stars and I made like
$20,000 before like some other thing

656
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
$20,000 before like some other thing
 

657
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,230
$20,000 before like some other thing
came in. And it's like it's it's

658
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
came in. And it's like it's it's
 

659
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,150
came in. And it's like it's it's
building on the sand is the the best way

660
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
building on the sand is the the best way
 

661
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,750
building on the sand is the the best way
that I could describe it. And while it

662
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
that I could describe it. And while it
 

663
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,269
that I could describe it. And while it
is interesting and I think if you're

664
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
is interesting and I think if you're
 

665
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,949
is interesting and I think if you're
interested, have a play around with it.

666
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
interested, have a play around with it.
 

667
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,389
interested, have a play around with it.
I'm probably going to jump in and have a

668
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
I'm probably going to jump in and have a
 

669
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,509
I'm probably going to jump in and have a
tinker around and see if I could cook

670
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
tinker around and see if I could cook
 

671
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,790
tinker around and see if I could cook
one up. If you guys want to see me do

672
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
one up. If you guys want to see me do
 

673
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,310
one up. If you guys want to see me do
that so you don't have to, just comment

674
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320

down below and let me know. And I am

676
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
down below and let me know. And I am
 

677
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,949
down below and let me know. And I am
going to be making a few more videos

678
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
going to be making a few more videos
 

679
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,430
going to be making a few more videos
around how to monetize it if you were to

680
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
around how to monetize it if you were to
 

681
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,949
around how to monetize it if you were to
go down that route. Um there's a few

682
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
go down that route. Um there's a few
 

683
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,190
go down that route. Um there's a few
interesting plays. And after you've

684
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
interesting plays. And after you've
 

685
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,870
interesting plays. And after you've
watched that video, maybe you'll have a

686
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
watched that video, maybe you'll have a
 

687
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,710
watched that video, maybe you'll have a
bit more context around should I make

688
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
bit more context around should I make
 

689
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,070
bit more context around should I make
the dive cuz it's like do you have

690
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
the dive cuz it's like do you have
 

691
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,470
the dive cuz it's like do you have
access to proprietary data? Do you have

692
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
access to proprietary data? Do you have
 

693
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,070
access to proprietary data? Do you have
a certain unfair advantage that would

694
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,080
a certain unfair advantage that would
 

695
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,350
a certain unfair advantage that would
mean you could create a successful

696
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
mean you could create a successful
 

697
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,590
mean you could create a successful
skill? But the thing is the the revenue

698
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
skill? But the thing is the the revenue
 

699
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,030
skill? But the thing is the the revenue
earning potential is not proven for

700
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
earning potential is not proven for
 

701
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,030
earning potential is not proven for
these. It could be the new app store. It

702
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
these. It could be the new app store. It
 

703
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,630
these. It could be the new app store. It
could be billionaires being made through

704
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
could be billionaires being made through
 

705
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,430
could be billionaires being made through
this. But it's just such a a risky place

706
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
this. But it's just such a a risky place
 

707
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,030
this. But it's just such a a risky place
to be playing for the vast majority of

708
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
to be playing for the vast majority of
 

709
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,110
to be playing for the vast majority of
you. So, I hope you can sort of be

710
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
you. So, I hope you can sort of be
 

711
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,389
you. So, I hope you can sort of be
self-aware enough to categorize yourself

712
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
self-aware enough to categorize yourself
 

713
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,910
self-aware enough to categorize yourself
into one or the other. But that's my

714
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
into one or the other. But that's my
 

715
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,190
into one or the other. But that's my
take on it, guys. I think it's really

716
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
take on it, guys. I think it's really
 

717
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,310
take on it, guys. I think it's really
important that we keep talking about

718
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
important that we keep talking about
 

719
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,310
important that we keep talking about
this stuff because I know it can feel

720
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
this stuff because I know it can feel
 

721
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,069
this stuff because I know it can feel
scary. I know like, man, that that new

722
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
scary. I know like, man, that that new
 

723
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,230
scary. I know like, man, that that new
surge is just like everyone's anxiety

724
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
surge is just like everyone's anxiety
 

725
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,990
surge is just like everyone's anxiety
level just like freaking spikes. But

726
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
level just like freaking spikes. But
 

727
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,269
level just like freaking spikes. But
we're all here. We're all in this

728
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
we're all here. We're all in this
 

729
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,790
we're all here. We're all in this
together. The market's big enough for

730
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
together. The market's big enough for
 

731
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,550
together. The market's big enough for
everyone and it's only growing every

732
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
everyone and it's only growing every
 

733
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,470
everyone and it's only growing every
day. So, let's build our houses upon the

734
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
day. So, let's build our houses upon the
 

735
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,910
day. So, let's build our houses upon the
rock, not the sand. But if you do fall

736
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
rock, not the sand. But if you do fall
 

737
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,430
rock, not the sand. But if you do fall
into that other category, then by all

738
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
into that other category, then by all
 

739
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,949
into that other category, then by all
means, have a crack. Uh, and I hope it

740
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
means, have a crack. Uh, and I hope it

like you'd expect me with my
 

763
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,630
like you'd expect me with my
distribution. I could be making all

push me up on Clawhub, but that's just a
distraction at this point. It's a

distraction at this point. It's a
 

773
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,829

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,069
classic shiny object syndrome. this new
flashy thing. Oh, maybe it will solve

776
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
flashy thing. Oh, maybe it will solve
 

777
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,509
flashy thing. Oh, maybe it will solve
all the the issues that I've had. Maybe

778
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
all the the issues that I've had. Maybe
 

779
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,350
all the the issues that I've had. Maybe
the reason I'm I'm struggling so much

780
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
the reason I'm I'm struggling so much
 

781
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,110
the reason I'm I'm struggling so much
with building a business is because I'm

782
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
with building a business is because I'm
 

783
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,269
with building a business is because I'm
not in this new thing. And it's just

784
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
not in this new thing. And it's just
 

785
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,590
not in this new thing. And it's just
guys, you need to stay stick with the

786
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
guys, you need to stay stick with the
 

787
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,949
guys, you need to stay stick with the
mission, man. Like, we know what we're

788
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
mission, man. Like, we know what we're
 

789

doing here. We know why we're here. We

790
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
doing here. We know why we're here. We
 

791
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,470
doing here. We know why we're here. We
know this massive opportunity that we've

792
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
know this massive opportunity that we've
 

793
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,389
know this massive opportunity that we've
been working away on for so long. And I

just want to give you guys a confidence
of what like I'm not I'm not changing

798
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
of what like I'm not I'm not changing
 

799
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,509
of what like I'm not I'm not changing
the strat. I'm not doing anything out of

800
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
the strat. I'm not doing anything out of
 

801
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,269
the strat. I'm not doing anything out of
the ordinary. I'm sticking to my guns

802
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
the ordinary. I'm sticking to my guns
 

803
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,630
the ordinary. I'm sticking to my guns
because I have so much conviction that

804
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
because I have so much conviction that
 

805
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,790
because I have so much conviction that
the the the skyscraper we're building on

806
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
the the the skyscraper we're building on
 

807
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,389
the the the skyscraper we're building on
the rock over at Morningside, on the

the rock over at Morningside, on the
 

809
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,150
the rock over at Morningside, on the
rock of the opportunity that we've we've

810
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
rock of the opportunity that we've we've
 

811
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,829
rock of the opportunity that we've we've
tracked from from cycle to cycle to

00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
tracked from from cycle to cycle to
 

813
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,190
tracked from from cycle to cycle to
cycle and we know is going to continue

to be a major piece of the puzzle moving

816
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
to be a major piece of the puzzle moving
 

817
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,430
to be a major piece of the puzzle moving
forward. As this technology races off,

818
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
forward. As this technology races off,
 

819
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,269
forward. As this technology races off,
we become even more valuable. They need

820
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
we become even more valuable. They need
 

821
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,389
we become even more valuable. They need
us more. And it's it's kind of

822
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
us more. And it's it's kind of
 

823
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,310
us more. And it's it's kind of
frustrating how little we get talked

824
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
frustrating how little we get talked
 

825
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,990
frustrating how little we get talked
about. you know, like it's always

826
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
about. you know, like it's always
 

827
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,430
about. you know, like it's always
talking about the the latest models and

talking about the the latest models and
 

829
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,710
talking about the the latest models and
this and this and all Silicon Valley's

00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
this and this and all Silicon Valley's
 

831

business and do the consulting portion,
 

873
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,190
business and do the consulting portion,
carry that through, use these AI coding

874
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
carry that through, use these AI coding
 

875

877
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,590
tools to rapidly get to actual ROI for
companies. And then we do step in again

878
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
companies. And then we do step in again
 

879
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,190
companies. And then we do step in again
and we're really needed in the training

880
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
and we're really needed in the training
 

881
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,030
and we're really needed in the training
piece. It's like we understand the

882
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
piece. It's like we understand the
 

883
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,710
piece. It's like we understand the
organizations enough, we understand the

884
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
organizations enough, we understand the
 

885
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,550
organizations enough, we understand the
politics and dynamics that we can work

886
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
politics and dynamics that we can work
 

887
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,990
politics and dynamics that we can work
within them to actually get this these

within them to actually get this these
 

889

within them to actually get this these
systems to stick. So, we are the we are

890
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
systems to stick. So, we are the we are
 

891
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,310
systems to stick. So, we are the we are
the the solution to the AI problem that

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
the the solution to the AI problem that
 

893
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,750
the the solution to the AI problem that
seemingly no one is really talking

seemingly no one is really talking
about. They expect all the SAS startups

00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
about. They expect all the SAS startups
 

897
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,190
about. They expect all the SAS startups
to do it when in fact we're the ones who

898
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
to do it when in fact we're the ones who
 

899
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,790
to do it when in fact we're the ones who
are in the trenches doing it. Um, and

900
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
are in the trenches doing it. Um, and
 

901
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,990
are in the trenches doing it. Um, and
that's why I'm so confident in the rock

902
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
that's why I'm so confident in the rock
 

903

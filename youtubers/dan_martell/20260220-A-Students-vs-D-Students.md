D students for sure end up being millionaires more than A students. D students are smart enough to know they're not [\h__\h] smart and then ask other smart people questions. They don'ting care about the rules. That's why they have success and they take risks. You sold something that you didn't even have. That is what D students do all day long. Oh, and A students are [\h__\h] it's got to be all perfect. D students sell the thing and they go figure out how to build it. They were too busy making money then [\h__\h] trying to perfect their grades. The richest people I know were all D students.

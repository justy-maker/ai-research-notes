If you're 15, 16, 17, 18 and you're starting from scratch, I would spend every second on AI. I would research it. I would read it. I would get a group of friends around it. Listen to podcasts while I'm sleeping. I would be in it nonstop. AI is like a mentor. You can tell it to act like the people you admire. I talked to a guy the other day, 6 weeks, he's been building his new software company, 10K a month. He's never written code in his life. How did he learn to do this AI?

My house burnt down last weekend and I was wondering how to make some money to support my family work. >> Okay. Do you have a job? >> Just landscaping for friends and stuff. >> Okay. But you don't work for a landscaping company? >> Okay. The big difference between me and everybody else is I will do right real time. Landscaping. You're going to call them. My name is Ryder and I would like to know where I have to go to apply for a job. Go do five >> and then come back. Ryder, you do those calls? >> I called. >> Okay. Yeah. >> What do you really need right now? >> Um, >> I don't know. >> I got a little bit of money to buy food for my family and stuff. >> How much you got? >> I started GoFundMe. I think I got like a,000 from that. >> All right. Add another thousand. >> I got you.

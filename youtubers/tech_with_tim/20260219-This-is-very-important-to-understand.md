## 轉錄內容

You need to build stuff on your own. You need to get hands-on experience in the code editor doing something completely from scratch that no one is helping you with. No one's holding your hands, no tutorials walking you through everything that you need to do. And you simply sit there and you figure out how to do it by yourself. Sure, you can consult different resources, but the point is you need to get that experience actually problem solving, debugging, working through the issues, planning out your code, and everything that any experienced developer does pretty much every single day. So, please do yourself a favor.

Coding has changed a lot over the last few years, and because of that, the way you should learn Python has also changed. If I was starting from absolute zero again in 2026, I would not follow most of the advice that's still floating around online. So, in this video, I want to walk you through exactly how I would learn Python as fast as possible today, step by step, without wasting time. Now, before I wrote a single line of Python, the very first thing I would do is research the language itself. not tutorials, not syntax, not variables. I would ask one question first. What is Python actually good at in 2026? And what do people really use it for? Now, Python is not just a beginner language. It's used heavily in back-end systems, automation, AI, data engineering, internal tooling, scripting, and it's the glue that really connects a lot of complex systems together. But it is not the best choice for everything, and that matters a lot. So before committing months of effort to learning this, I would make sure that Python actually aligns with what I want to build or where I want to end up. Now at this stage, what I would do is set a concrete goal. So something simple but real, right? Maybe I want to automate part of my job. Maybe I want to build a small API. Maybe I want to work towards AI adjacent roles. the exact goal doesn't really matter as much as just having one because learning without direction is one of the biggest reasons that people quit or bounce between languages and never end up getting good at them. Now once I was confident that Python is the right tool for me only then would I touch the next step which is my development setup. So again to summarize I'm researching Python. I'm understanding what my goal actually is and I'm making sure the Python lines up with that so it's actually worth me putting my effort into learning. So, as I mentioned, the next step is my development setup. Now, this part should be pretty quick, but a lot of beginners do mess this up and then they end up suffering for weeks. Now, I would first make sure that Python is installed correctly. I would understand how to run scripts, how virtual environments work at a basic level. That's really important. And how to use a proper code editor. So, something like cursor for example, you know, a Jet Brains IDE. Doesn't really matter. You don't need to learn 10 of them, but just pick one. Now, you definitely do not need to be a tooling expert here, but you need to feel comfortable running code, right? You know, fixing simple errors, knowing where a file lives, what a folder in a directory is, how to spin something up, open the terminal, etc. So, it's overall super important just to get that in place and understand the basics before we move on to the next step. Now, once my setup was complete, this is where I would spend the bulk of my time and really a lot of my early effort. Now, this is the fundamentals, right? So, data types, variables, operators, conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, sets, functions. That's it. I know it sounds like a lot of topics, but these really cover the core group of concepts that represent a majority of programming logic that you're going to use for years, regardless of if you stick with Python. Now, you don't need to master everything that I just mentioned, but you do need to understand how they work and when to use them. So being able to read and write basic Python code, write simple projects, and be able to go on the computer and without assistance code up something simple that's, you know, 40, 50 lines of code, write a few functions, call them, pass some arguments, you know, put some variables. That's extremely important and you need to master that first. Now, in terms of how I would actually learn these concepts, well, early on, I would still use videos. Not because videos are magic, but because when you're brand new to something, you don't really know what you don't know, right? So, if you have a good instructor, especially on video, this is going to expose to you a lot of patterns, vocabulary, and mental models that you wouldn't think to search for on your own. So, what I would do is spend a day or two sampling different resources. I would watch maybe the first 10 or 15 minutes of several beginners tutorials and I would pay attention to whether the explanations make sense to me and whether the instructor actually explains why things work instead of just typing code. Then after I found some good resources, I would commit to just one resource and stick with it for several hours just to make sure that I'm not switching between a bunch of different stuff. Now, while I was watching these videos, I would not passively just consume it. I would code alongside the video. So, pause constantly, type everything out myself, try to predict what's going to happen next, you know, asking questions, and a 15-minute video might take me an hour to finish. It's not because I'm being slow. It's because I'm being effective and methodical in my learning. But here's the thing, right? And this is why I say this. Studies have shown that when you're just watching tutorials or reading blog posts, you're only absorbing about 20% of the material. But when you learn actively by actually writing code and building things, that retention can jump as high as 75 to 90%. Now, that's a massive difference. And honestly, that's why I recommend Data Camp when you're first starting out with Python. The platform is super interactive. You're writing real code, getting instant feedback, and building projects from day one instead of just passively learning. Now, Data Camp is sponsoring this video, and I'm excited to tell you about their two Python learning tracks because they're genuinely something I wish I had when I was just getting started many years ago. Now, I've used Data Camp myself, and I've been recommending it for a while now across many videos on this channel. So, if you're just starting, I'd highly recommend the Python programming fundamentals track, which is designed to teach you the basics, right? So things I mentioned, variables, functions, all the way up to working with data. And if you're looking to push things to the next level, then you can check out the associate Python developer track, which dives deeper into real world skills like working with APIs, data structures, and debugging. Both of the tracks are hands-on, project-driven, and designed to help you practice Python interactively instead of just consuming content. And right now, Data Camp is offering 25% off using my link in the description. So, if you're serious about learning Python the right way, don't miss out and check it out. Now, once I've gone through the basics and understand them at a pretty good level, this is where the 2026 learning is really going to diverge from the old advice that I would have given. Now, I would start using AI immediately, not as a crutch, but I would use it to generate practice problems for myself and to test my understanding. So, what I would do is I would prompt AI to give me small focused exercises to target the specific weaknesses that I had. So if I'm bad at for loops for example, I'd ask for for loop exercises. If I don't understand dictionaries, I'd drill those, right? AI is extremely good at generating beginner level practice and then checking those answers. So this removes one of the biggest bottlenecks in learning, right? Which is not knowing how or where to practice. So I would do hundreds of these practice problems, not all at once, but consistently doing like 10, 20, 30 per day so that I wasn't just memorizing different concepts, but actually getting comfortable with the kind of conceptual understanding. And again, not focusing on memorizing the syntax, but being able to understand a dictionary, understand a for loop, and really get that kind of theory knocked into my brain because of that interactive learning. So rather than using AI just to generate a bunch of code for me, I'm actually using it as my personal assistant or my tutor to generate just unlimited practice so I get very good very fast. Now after I've used that to really make sure that I've mastered the fundamentals, what I would do is start building some beginner projects. Not massive ones, but just simple complete programs that combine multiple concepts together. Now this is where you start learning how code is structured, not just how individual lines of code work. So, I would likely start by following full project walkthroughs on platforms like YouTube, but I wouldn't stay dependent on them. Now, the key shift here is that you want to treat tutorials like a reference material, not instructions that you go through step by step. So, if I was watching a project guide, I'd try to implement sections myself before watching that section. And I would compare what I did to what the instructor did. You know, a few days later, I'd attempt to maybe rebuild parts of the project from memory. The struggle here is where the learning actually happens. You need to put yourself in situations where you're uncomfortable. You don't know what you're doing so that you kind of figure it out and you build that skill. Now, once I'm comfortable building small programs, this is when I would start to introduce object-oriented programming. Not on day one and not before I understand functions and data structures, but oop makes more sense when you've already felt the pain of messy code. So, at this point, you know, classes, objects, and methods are actually going to solve real problems for me instead of feeling really abstract. So, I would definitely learn that topic. Now, after that, I would deliberately build something fun or personally interesting. So, rather than just grinding a bunch of theory, I would pick some project that maybe I'm not going to learn something new in, but that I just really want to build. So, like a small game, an automation script, you know, a tool that solves a real annoyance that I have in my life. Now, this step is really important because you have to enjoy what you're doing here. If you don't have enjoyment when you're coding, you're just going to fall off. And the people that are the best developers genuinely have a passion for what they're doing and they can work so hard on something because it's actually interesting to them. So make sure that you keep that kind of enjoyment and passion alive and you don't focus on optimizing everything 100% and you give yourself those breaks to actually build something interesting. Now once I've done that, I would move into Python for web development. So even if I didn't want to be a web developer, it's super important to understand things like APIs, right? learning about HTTP requests, responses, basic Python modules like Django, Flask, fast API, and how to interact with external services from Python. So, I would definitely start with something lightweight. So, I would just build a simple API and then I would explore more structured frameworks, again, more complex stuff like Django. Now, the goal isn't to master all of these frameworks here. It's to understand the ecosystem and how Python can fit into real systems. Now, after that, I would look at more advanced Python features. So things like decorators, generators, context managers, and dunder methods. You're not going to use these every single day, but understanding them will dramatically improve your ability to read and reason about other people's code, especially in some of those frameworks and libraries that now I would have a little bit of understanding. Now, if I had made it to this point, I would no longer just be learning Python. Overall, I would kind of know Python, right? I wouldn't know everything, but I would know the basics of the language. I would know some of the frameworks. I would know the ecosystem. And what would come next for me is specialization. So picking like AI, data, back-end systems, automation, DevOps doesn't really matter. It's whatever aligns with your original goal, but going into that niche because Python becomes a tool, not the overall focus, right? And that's really the shift that a lot of people need to learn once they get through the basics of kind of programming languages is that learning something like Python is not about finishing tutorials. It's about building things, solving problems, and gradually increasing the complexity of what it is that you're working on. Now, this is exaggerated when you pick a particular niche, and you start getting good in one particular area. You can't be an expert web developer and a machine learning engineer. You need to pick one. But if you can pick one, then you can really start building some depth in that particular area. And that's how I would continue the rest of my learning. Now, look, this is not the only way to do it. But if I were starting again in 2026 and I wanted results as fast as possible, this is personally the path that I would follow. Let me know if you agree with me or disagree with me in the comments down below. I would love to hear your thoughts.

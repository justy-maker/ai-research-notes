 You know what's really fascinating to me is empathy requires you to feel what somebody else is feeling.  Kindness requires you to do something about it.  You do not need empathy to be kind.  That's something that I find interesting.  You can be kind without feeling.  And some people will be like, no, you can.  You can literally not feel.  You may not feel what the other person is feeling, but you go, you know what?  I think they deserve justice.  I think they need help.  I think that I can't feel what they're going through.  But the opposite isn't you can have empathy and no kindness.  And that's that's something that stuck with me as I was thinking about it.  In fact, you know, when we're talking now about Ukraine, Russia, the world, everything we're going through.  One of the biggest things I've noticed is populists are brilliant at weaponizing empathy.  Do you know what I mean?  Wherever you go in the world, populists are brilliant at feeling  what people are feeling.  Criticize Donald Trump all you want.  That man feels what many Americans feel.  He knows how to feel it for them.  How he acts doesn't necessarily address what they're feeling, but boy, does he feel it.  Victor Orban, you go wherever you want in the world.  These people are good at weaponizing the empathy because they go, I do feel what you're feeling.  And so I'm going to act on it in a way that may not address what you feel.  So I have a question and I like this.  I like the breaking these things to down.  So if somebody can express empathy, do people just give them credit that things they do are  kind because they feel the empathy?  Yes.  So here's the best analogy I can think of.  If you've ever been to a hospital and you've ever had to be helped by people in  like the medical industry, nurses in particular, I find this with a lot of nurses are  not nice.  They really aren't.  But they're kind and what I mean by that is like they do what they need to do to  help you and they really do it.  And I've seldom met a nurse who doesn't go above and beyond to help you get to  where you need to get to helping the doctor address your needs, helping the  hospital move.  They're often overworked there, but they very seldom nice.  Do you know what I mean?  But they're very kind and I always think to myself, what would it be like  if they were the opposite?  What would be if they specialized in empathy, but not being kind?  They would come in and they'd be like, oh, it must feel so bad.  Oh, I can only imagine what it feels like.  You are describing your heart having this attack.  Oh, oh, I know how you must feel right now.  Describing an AI friend.  That's exactly what it is.  You're describing an AI friend.  And can I tell you, and can I tell you, that's exactly what I think of  when people will tell me, you know, when people are like, the AI  thinks, the AI feels, it can connect with you.  It can share.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, it can pretend to connect.  It can pretend.  It can perform these acts of empathy because it can write them the way  we perceive them, but it cannot do and the doing fundamentally becomes  the thing that separates us.  You know, the annoying thing about kindness.  The annoying thing about kindness is very often for the person  being kind for them.  It's easy or obvious like they're driven by cause or faith or purpose  or it's a, they have a talent.  They're just, they're good at asking, you know, checking in on  someone or they lean into it when somebody's struggling.  That general who said go on.  I don't think he perceived that as an act of courage is just  something you do.  Right.  And I think again, that goes back to where I started, which  is acknowledging kindness and saying thank you or receiving the  gift when it is given is an incentive for them to keep doing  it because I think very often they don't realize how kind  they're being when they're being kind.  Yes.  Which plays to a lot of what we heard while we're here  going right back to the beginning to Arthur Brooks, which is  having that sense of purpose, having that sense of cause or  faith as number one is the thing that might help us be more  kind because the actions that we're supposed to take others  then become obvious and easy.

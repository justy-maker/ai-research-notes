 kindness being received is a more emotionally overwhelming experience than  kindness being given. Kindness being given we talk about it's good to be kind,  it's nice to be kind, but how many of us are actually adept at receiving kindness?  I think some of us are embarrassed by it, some of us don't know how to react to  it, and I have what I'm processing is one of the acts of kindness is to  receive kindness. When somebody gives you a gift and you say no no no, and  they say but I bought this for you and you say no no no, it becomes rude to  reject the gift at some point, and at the end of the day to simply say thank you,  thank you, makes the other person feel good. So even if you're uncomfortable by  the compliment, the gift, the act of kindness, the act of warmth, the act of  generosity, there's a great act of kindness in the reception of  kindness as well, because what kindness is is community. It's the forming, it's  the foundation of community, and so we have to remember community is both  ways. I define community as a group of people who agree to grow together, and so  if we agree to grow together that means kindness must beget kindness must  beget kindness, and this is where trust comes.

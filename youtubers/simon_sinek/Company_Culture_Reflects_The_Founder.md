 So our careers are one of the things we do to bring our why to life.  It's one of the tangible representations of who we are.  So if you're the owner of the business, the business's why will be the same as yours, right?  And if you chose a Chick-fil-A franchise, I hope it's not simply because you pulled  the numbers out on a spreadsheet and be like, oh, look how good this is.  This is the one I want.  I hope you made a values decision that I like who the company is.  I like what the founders stand for.  I like what the organization stands for.  I can see myself in this organization and its values because the choices we're making  to be a part of this says something about who we are.  So the company is me and I am the company.  It's sort of reflexive and reflective and how you build your culture within that.  And think of it like the nation, right?  There is something called the United States.  The United States has a set of values that no matter where we're from, we share American  values, right?  Now, if you're from California or you're from Alabama or you're from Connecticut, very  different, right?  But they're all American.  Like Alabama doesn't belong in France.  And California doesn't belong in China, right?  Like they belong in America.  And so you can have variation within the system, but at the end of the day, we all have a common  set of values and beliefs that connect us all.  And if you belong here, you share those values and beliefs.  And you can put your own spin on them.  You can bring it to life your own way.  You can bring your personality to bear it in your culture.  And it still fits even if one's completely different from another.  It belongs here.

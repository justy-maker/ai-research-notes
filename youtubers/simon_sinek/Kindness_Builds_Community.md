 kindness doesn't hold the same etymology and origin that it does in English so in  most languages kindness can be traced to generosity and benevolence in French I  think it has a very similar meaning in Arabic there's a word that's like held  very deeply it means to be like of service to be generous to be kind in  Chinese there's a word in Russian you go through in Greek all of them they  all come back to generosity generosity or service not generosity  benevolence service all of them but it's all different in the different  languages the origin of kind I find very interesting in English because I think  it gives us an insight into what might be missing in today's world and it it's  what makes it complex human kind the same kind kindred my kin that's literally  where it comes from in English we are the same kind you trace the word back  and the word kind came from saying you or me and I am you that's where it came  from and so when we are saying we are being kind to one another in English the  origin of it meant I'm seeing you as me and I'm believing that you are seeing  me as you right and as I've been thinking about it I've been going oh  that's that's probably why we're struggling to live in a world that is  kind because for various reasons we now live in a world where everyone is the  audience of one do you know what I mean and we see each other is more different  yeah that's what I mean by the audience of one where and if kindness is if the  kindness and etymologically the foundation of community then how can we  ever be a community there's no such thing as community or tribe or  belonging no or safety without kindness the two literally are impossible to have  kindness is the thing that creates the feeling of safety yes because we have to  be the same so okay I'll give you a simple example yesterday every one's  having every different conversation everyone's talking about everything  musicians artists the business people you name it it was fascinating to see what  happened when the tweets between Elon Musk and Donald Trump came out we  all became the same kind that moment connected everybody everyone started  saying did you see what happened did you see what happened oh my good what do  you think but what I what I find most fascinating in that moment is that  everyone everyone became the same kind and I realized that those moments are  more valuable than we think because as we live in a world where everything is  becoming for you right your your internet pages for you your algorithm is for  you your TV shows are for you right because you stream you don't even have  to watch things at the same time as everybody else like when I grew up  I had to watch what my parents were watching and sometimes they had to  watch what I was watching because that was the TV now you live in a world where  every single person in the household can watch whatever they want how they want  and while that's great for your personal enjoyment of life it means you are less  of the same kind you know so now you you don't have the same reference you  don't have the same joke you don't have the same news you don't have the  same story and if you live in a world like that how do you then think that  the other person deserves what you deserve or thinks what you think it goes  back to sacrifice which is to be kind I have to give something up of myself for  myself for someone else in this moment I have to watch my parents TV show even  though I don't want to because that's that's the deal you may not have seen  it as kind and but you could have gone away but you didn't you sat on the  couch and just watched yeah you were just there because it was nice to be  as a family so so just kind and we heard it again I'll go back to you  know me you know the the the missionaries who are kind to rescue her and her  mother yes put themselves at great sacrifice and their sacrifices of life  their sacrifices of humiliation their sacrifices of being rejected from your  own tribe by putting yourself out there that these acts of kindness are are  highly risky because they involve doing because they involve doing but they  also involve they also they also involve putting yourself out there  F4 for for yourself or for another which you said kindness to yourself but I but I  think the doing is the biggest thing we heard it weird a few people up here  saying it in different ways obviously the most recent being Brian but the  doing you know you know what's hard about doing other than the obvious is  it requires more

Well, if you look at most people's bios, and let's be honest, we write our own bios, right? Um, you can see how people define themselves, it's, you know, you know, it'll say, uh, the title, you know, owner operator, it'll say CEO, it'll say, uh, Oscar nominated actor, whatever it is. And so, we're we're talking about ourselves based on a position we hold or something we did 20 years ago. Um, but that's not who we are. And I see this happen to a lot of people, usually more successful people, believe it or not, which is they completely uh intertwine their identities with their with their jobs. And if they stop doing their jobs, they retire, they move on, whatever it is, they have crazy identity crisis. I'll give you an example. Um there's a very high-powered CEO that everybody here would know and definitely know the company and he left his job. was his time to retire and uh um he thought he was you know going to be stay busy and all that and there was a big Hollywood party that he that that he would get invited to every year and he didn't get an invitation this year and a friend of his was over and said you got your invitation right and the guy goes yeah of course I got me my invitation goes I didn't I didn't get mine you know I I I maybe they got lost he he never could understand that they were never inviting him and they were inviting his title >> and so when he didn't have his title he didn't have an identity. And so I realized this years ago that I wanted to I wanted to I wanted to be feel about myself who I was. So whenever you see me blurb a book or if you see my bio, it says optimist >> and author. And so I am I will be an optimist till the day I die. But the stuff I do will change throughout my life. So I want to be defined by who I am, not what I do.

 Companies tend to do a very good job of teaching  their employees the job they need to do,  how to work the fryer, how to work the oven,  whatever it is, how to talk to a customer, you know?  We tend, there's a lot of opportunity to do better  in teaching people how to listen,  how to give and receive back, which we talked about,  how to have a difficult conversation.  That's a hard one.  These are human skills.  How to have empathy,  how to replace judgment with curiosity.  These are all teachable, learnable skills.  And it's one of the annoying things about being human,  you know, which is cats don't have to work very hard  to be cats, they're just really naturally good at it.  And humans have to work really hard  to be good at being human.  We are not naturally good at it.  And this is why relationships,  whether it's romantic relationships, friendships,  or work relationships, are clunky and messy and difficult.  And if you have a bad night's sleep  or something bad happen at home,  all that stress comes to work.  And so starting with empathy is a great entry point.  And I'll give you an example of empathy at work.  You know, here's pretty normal situation.  Hey, your performance is down for the third week in a row.  We've had this conversation before,  if you don't pick up your performance,  I don't know what's gonna happen.  Fairly normal.  Let's replace that.  Not most effective.  Not most effective.  Let's replace that with empathy, right?  Hey, your performance is down for the third week in a row.  We've had this conversation before.  Are you okay?  I'm worried about you.  What's going on?  Very different.  And you may not get an answer immediately,  because especially if something's vulnerable,  they may not wanna share immediately.  But that feeling that somebody actually cares about me  as a human being, not just as a performance machine,  goes a long way.

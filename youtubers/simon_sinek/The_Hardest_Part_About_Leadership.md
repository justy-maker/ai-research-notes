 People say, I want to have kids.  Nobody ever says, I would like to raise kids for 18 years.  Not just 18.  Yeah, 25 years.  Having kids is the fun easy part.  Raising kids is the part that every new parent is like,  what the?  Oh, parenthood.  Every new parent I know  was so excited when they're holding their baby  and then the changes.  The leadership is kind of similar,  which is everybody's like, oh my God,  I own my own businesses.  Okay, now you have to lead.  The people, people.  And that's the part that's really hard,  unexpected, and sometimes lonely and unrewarding.  And, you know, it's the frustrating part.  The process is easy.  You can figure that out.  There are systems you can master,  but the people part is ongoing and sometimes overwhelming.  And so, like being a parent,  the best leaders, by choice or because they're forced to,  become students of leadership.  They read books.  They read articles.  They come to things like this.  They watch talks.  Just like when you're a parent.  You talk to your parents.  You talk to your friends.  How they're doing things.  You read books.  You watch talks.  It's the same thing.  You have to become a student of the thing  that you expect you're going to have to do.  And like being a parent,  it's worth it for the unexpected glimmers.  When you see your team come together  to solve a problem without you.  Just like you catch your kids sharing  when you didn't expect it, you know?  It's the unexpected glimmers of somebody  who's all of a sudden has this confidence  and is like becoming a leader themselves.  And it'll happen at times that you can't predict,  and it'll make the journey worth it.  I mean, that's what service is, remember.  This is what it means to serve,  which is we want to see those around us rise.  And to serve those who serve others  is the greatest joy anyone can achieve in life.  I believe that true purpose  is the opportunity to serve those who serve others.
